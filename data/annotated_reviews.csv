Many people are giving a hard time on the game in the reviews.Honestly it's not all that bad. Firstly the devs promised to fix majority of issues in few upcoming months which is already WOAH makes me really happy. Secondly the game itself is quite good yes you may have lags and bugs here and there but it's not that horrible. Would still recommend this game despite all it's cons.,Performance and Optimization,negative,0

don t get me wrong it is an awesome game. but why the hell do a full prise/Ea prise game need microtransactions don't support it!! this is only a beginning of more over pricing games for content that shot not be behind a pay wall when we already paid for a full game.,Monetization,negative,0

The optimisation in this game could use alot of work. The first fews games you play are fustrating to say the least but after them you get into the rythm of the game and actully kill some scrubs. Would say the game is best played with a squad. The most fun thing in this game too do would have to be longrange kills there so satsfying.,Performance and Optimization,negative,0

The game needs an indicator as to where shots are comming from there really isen't a gun flash or anything once a player missed me 20 times while i was trying to find him and i could not see him. This seems to be the essence of the game if you see someone and get to first shot you win. There is no real counterplay but to hide until you see them move kind of bad when most of the gameplay is bushwookie simulator.However i do like playing the game it is really fun at most times and the urban combat is really fun.The only reason i am making a negativ review is so that people that have yet to buy the game now some of the cons to the game.,combat,positive,0

Damn game ur ing game is too many crushed. sometime i think buying pubg is wasting my money,money,negative,0
good game but i just cant recommend based on the fact that friendly fire is enabled so team killing is frequent when playing with randoms. sometimes your teammates will just kill you for the loot as if you were the enemy. ill change this to a positive review with pros and cons if friendly fire gets disabled as friendly fire has no place in this game. untill then this is all ive got to say about it.,Multiplayer Experience,negative,0

Shotgun to the head from 1 foot away.... No kill...... 2 shots from 9mm to your body with body armor lvl 2 on... you die............ Seems legit.......... Throw a greade under people... They dont die.... Real life they wouldnt have legs....... Good game IDEA....... But as far as weapons go NOTHING realistic... Play as a noob win like a pro.. Shoot for the heads though like pro gamers do . and you will be killed by a noob with a BB gun shooting your toe. Damage system is totally screwed over... If its ever fixed I might rewrite this. Till then RIP PUBG..,Gameplay Mechanics,negative,0

Such a BUGGY unoptimized piece of software every update fixes nothing.Seems like only streamers running 1080 sli rigs can even get a stable frame rate that!!.Frames drop from 45 to 6 in a second just from looking inside a house which shouldnt be more intensive than rendering a whole ing game worlds geography.Dont get me wrong i love the premise and the non stop action and tense environment make a really cool experience but unitl this thing becomes stable and you can exit a match without the game crashing every and i mean every time its not worth the money.If it was a cheaper game due to the early access state of the game i wouldnt mind but for the money the devs ask for i expect at least a stable ux and a stable frame rate i wouldnt even mind if there was a frame lock option or something like that.When it comes to the games content things can always be added and new ideas and concepts can be developed but when it comes to optimisation and how the user can use the gui it either works or it dosent and this simply dosent.The unreal 4 engine is really cool but there is alot of work to be done here which i hope does happen.,Performance and Optimization,negative,0

Thought they would fix there bugs in open but they didnt. Also cant que up by yourself cause the chinese took over the NA servers. You will get them talking Cantonese or some other language. They made more bugs in the 1.0 release than test servers. Also was expecting zombie mode but I guess BlueBalls let us down again.,bugs,negative,1

The devs absolutly broke this game... I once had so much fun with it and now as everyone states. It's one hell of a money grab.

Probably the best Battle Royale game out there+ Solid battle royale gameplay. Drop from a plane collect loot kill players get pushed in closer and closer try to be the last man standing. The gun play is pretty realistic and it's always fun to get into an intense firefight.+ Great fun with friends+ Very High Replayability+ First Person and Third Person modes.+ Vehicles + Depening on how well you do you earn battle points. You can use these to get crates which you can sell on the market for profit OR open them for a cosmetic item. More of a personal note When playing in a squad it's very common for one of your friends to get knocked down and within a second they get killed with no chance of reviving them. This causes you to either leave the game or your friends have to sit there in boredom watching you play the remainder of the game. Can be frustratingly repetitive. Example Spending 20minutes looting / looking for players and then suddenly getting sniped across the map. Not enough map variety (there are only two maps currently) Lots of bugs... from randomly flipping off a bike taking heavy damage parachuting from the plane glitching inside loading buildings etc.SIde Note This is a game I never thought I'd enjoy,Gameplay Mechanics,positive,0

"Brilliant game excellent teamwork and strategy/tactics involved. Don't join a game that isn't solo without a mic you're putting others at a disadvantage and being a complete prick.I would rate this game 8/10would be 10 if it wasn't for bugs and optimization needed but I see them coming in the near future.If you recieve ""Network lag detected"" or simple frame drop to a crazy amount. What you need to do is hold ALT and press F4 while holding it.Instant fps boost removes network lag.10/10 265m kill with kar98k in a few days of buying the game some are good at close range some at med some at high. High range is not your average CoD building to building but literally 200m to 1km away. Me and my squad have managed to knock people out from at least 300 500m away just a shame his teammate was close to revive!Buy this game if you have friends and love shooters. There's also an FPS only mode for solo duo squad play. Excellent game would recommend to all!",Gameplay Mechanics,positive,0

Defining the Battle Royale Genre. As we approach a new year a fresh trend enters the established medium of gaming Battle Royale. PUBG is the catalyst for this uproar being responsible for spawning even newer titles (or changes) such as Fortnite Rules of Survival and the H1Z1 controversy. + The Pros Vehicles Out of all the battle royale games that have been released thus far this has the widest variety of vehicles to choose from all with their own upsides and downsides. Granted control whilst driving can be a chore (or unfair sometimes) but otherwise it's satisfying to use.Gunplay Once again PUBG has the best gun control that any battle royale game has to offer. Not only that but I'd argue that it's gunplay is more effecient than other FPS focused titles in the industry. Replayability This game can be out right addicting and it never seems to disappoint me every round I play (with some exceptions). With friends it's only more enjoyable. So if you're searching for long term investments for any particular game this is a must have in your wishlist.

Throughout the pros I mentioned that most of the rounds I encountered were enjoyable and engaging. Suffice to say the exceptions to that consistency is this particular issue.Variety If this game was still in Early Access I wouldn't have pointed this out. However PUBG recently released a full release with a major update that enhances its graphics and optimization. On one hand the optimization issue that was profound in the previous version is adjusted. On the other hand the variety in maps and weaponry still feel somewhat lacking. For a $30 game there should be more content. That's not to say that the rest of the gameplay doesn't make up for these glaring flaws.

Defining the Battle Royale Genre. As we approach a new year a fresh trend enters the established medium of gaming Battle Royale. PUBG is the catalyst for this uproar being responsible for spawning even newer titles (or changes) such as Fortnite Rules of Survival and the H1Z1 controversy. + The Pros Vehicles Out of all the battle royale games that have been released thus far this has the widest variety of vehicles to choose from all with their own upsides and downsides. Granted control whilst driving can be a chore (or unfair sometimes) but otherwise it's satisfying to use.Gunplay Once again PUBG has the best gun control that any battle royale game has to offer. Not only that but I'd argue that it's gunplay is more effecient than other FPS focused titles in the industry. Replayability This game can be out right addicting and it never seems to disappoint me every round I play (with some exceptions). With friends it's only more enjoyable. So if you're searching for long term investments for any particular game this is a must have in your wishlist. The Cons Hackers Although I do believe that players have exaggerated this issue it still maintains its relevance in the general experience. Throughout the pros I mentioned that most of the rounds I encountered were enjoyable and engaging. Suffice to say the exceptions to that consistency is this particular issue.Variety If this game was still in Early Access I wouldn't have pointed this out. However PUBG recently released a full release with a major update that enhances its graphics and optimization. On one hand the optimization issue that was profound in the previous version is adjusted. On the other hand the variety in maps and weaponry still feel somewhat lacking. For a $30 game there should be more content. That's not to say that the rest of the gameplay doesn't make up for these glaring flaws. Final Verdict Whether you hate or enjoy the Battle Royale genre I would recommend anyone this game. There's a lot of enjoyment that can be had with this game especially with friends.EDIT This review is outdated due to recent business practices.

This game burnt out and broke my EVGA GTX 970 after 5 hours of gameplay it's a great concept of a game but not worth the money if you don't have an ultra PC because of the dreadful optimisation.Would give it a thumbs up if it didn't break my graphics card.,Performance and Optimization,negative,0
Optimisation is beyond terrible makes a great game extremely frustrating to play. Not yet worth the 30 euro don't bother purchasing until they iron out the bugs and there are a lot.Revised review Everything about this game is a shameful cash grab years later the game runs just as bad as it did in early access. Not surprising they've lost 50% of their playerbase this year alone. Goodbye PUBG I wish I could say it was fun but your game is a pile of and always has been.,Performance and Optimization,negative,0

I started off and almost at once I was killed by a wolf. Started again and the same thing. I quit after that but came back a few days later. I learned to avoid the wolves and I started to see the potential in this game. The gathering of supplies the crafting and the scavenging are all cool to figure out and attempt to learn. However the game does have some framerate issues and graphical bugs. However I can look past that for now as this game is in alpha. I just hope that eventually this game grows into the masterpiece I can see buried under all the early alpha crap a game experiences.,crafting,positive,0

Out of all the reviews I wrote This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!,community,negative,3
I have approximatley 280hours on this game. The game is fun in concept however in actual execution it is a broken POS.Lag and latencey issues are terrible and un avoiadable. You can be shot at run several meters behind cover and then seconds later the hits will register and you lose health or die. Gun play is never consistant due to variences in server latency. Lag in the beginning of the game even makes it difficult to pick up critical items. Its very frusrating when this is always present and you don't really get to enjoy the game for what it is.Cheating is huge and it seems like the developers don't mind it. Get used to being killed by people with digits as a name who hip fire headshots at 200 meters.The game was much funner in the beginning of early access. Unfortuanly the developers are in a virtual urinating contest with fort nite so you will see more useless features added (the emoji system) rather then the real gameplay issues being addressed. This WAS the best battle royal. Thankfully battle royal games are the flavor of the week and another good one will be around soon.,lag,negative,1

Honestly It was worth the wait. Thank you Rockstar for making one of the best pc ports of existence. The rain runs well at a full 60 fps most of time in Very high Settings. However unpacking simulator isn't a far off synonym to this title. The game is well polished and the online servers are actually a lot better compared to the consoles.

GTAV is a great game. It is really. The visuals are stunning. Everything about the story/single player is fantastic. I previously had a long review about how the Online was kinda ed up but I got tired of even seeing it in my reviews list. Soooo I edited this review with a writing chainsaw.GTAV is beautiful complex interesting thrilling and funny. Since I'm also weak and attached to material possessions I'd just give it a 10/10 because it allows me to buy stupidly expensive supercars and to drive them slowly in the suburbs with dope music sending bass all around.The story is great and there are of course tons of easter eggs and things to discover. The game is also moddable which is nice.Now GTA Online is a great experience. Well it's true that there are... Hum... Well some loading times. And yeah it's true that apparently it's also moddable leading to lobbys being sometimes clean and sometimes full of hackers. But with the latest updates it's feels even more alive.And of course since I can also drive around town in my stupidly expensive cars and this time not only for my pleasure but for the pleasure of showing off like hell I still recommend playing it.1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play,Graphics and Visuals,positive,0

"For 59$'s it isn't worth it maybe get it on sale like I did I remember I got it on sale for Christmas it was brought down half so that was nice. Maybe 30 40 is a nice price I know it takes a lot to make these games but it isn't worth it. Online wasn't great either as you start having modders on PC and some consoles. I'm glad I tried this game but like I said for the price I got it at it was well worth. If I got it for 60$'s I would've been disappointed. The story was great and have played it was twice and very great all though it doesn't have that ""story line"" that you can follow it's just kind of characters you are given and then you start following a story I wish GTA would follow through with GTA 4 story would match GTA 5 better.",Story and Narrative,positive,0
