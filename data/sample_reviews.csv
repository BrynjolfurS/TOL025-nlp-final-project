146170,2018-03-03,2,2,227,False,Not Recommended,Final nail in the coffin for me buying another Rockstar Game. Or even even Take2 for that matter.This game is increadably boring. The singleplayer is. I have about 7 hours of singleplayer under my belt that all of those 7 hours I fully regret. A wast empty world that feels extremely fake even with many things to do in it.And don't get me started on the awful driving! Why couldn't they stick with the fun GTA 4 driving that you actualy had to learn how to drive not this mess that is designed for a 12 year old as if they're gonna play the... Oh wait...And multiplayer is about 20 hours actualy me enjoying my time there and the other 200 hours are me grinding to do things so I can have fun. What a cash grab.In conclusion RIP Rockstar along with their franchise. If you want to play the last real GTA games play San Andreas and GTA 4 with the DLC.,Grand Theft Auto V

135028,2017-07-01,1,2,111,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be great. I remeber first playing GTA online with my buddies in middle school on my xbox 360. The first time I logged in nobody had a super garage with 64 vehicles stored inside. it was survival in the streets of Los Santos everyone was scrambling to create their gangs and there was a mad rush to get the more powerful vehicles in the game (buzzard rhino tank etc..) It was an environment unlike any other I had ever seen in the gaming world It was amazing. But alas all good things must come to an end. Once they started coming out with these ridiculous DLC's with blatantly op weapons guns vehicles and so on it really ruined the game. And now they outlawed our mods? these guys. They dont deserve any of the money they've earned and I have no clue why this game is #2 on global top sellers in 2017. Very sad. Pirate this game to play the single player but please dont pay any amount of money for this monstrocity of a video game its not worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V

I learned to avoid the wolves and I started to see the potential in this game. The gathering of supplies the crafting and the scavenging are all cool to figure out and attempt to learn. However the game does have some framerate issues and graphical bugs. However I can look past that for now as this game is in alpha. I just hope that eventually this game grows into the masterpiece I can see buried under all the early alpha crap a game experiences.,Rust

I do not have any food or shelter yet however I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times.. What a mysterious island.Day 2I have found a chicken some more wood and a few stones I was able to conceive an amateur handmade axe it only took a few seconds to make so I was able to kill the chicken too. I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood I might be able to build a makeshift shelter but for now...Tonight I feast.Day 3Today is the day I will finally build a shelter I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already. I haven't felt this good since I was a child playing with my toys I remember one toy more than most it was called a ""Steam"" ahh the good ol' days.I will be home soon. I promise.Day 4I'm sorry.I have killed a man.It all happened so fast he was holding a gun I was debating on making peace with him but he seemed the brutal sort.And all of his gear it was... Enticing.He must have had a family but I am becoming selfish it seems I don't care about the man that I have killed.All that I can think of is one thing not my family not his family...But tonight I feast.Day 5I've come across a small abandoned town there seems to be a lot of loot within the area.The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers.I have a choice Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation or live on how I am now.. In poverty.I think I'll live.Just for a while longer.Day 6I saw a man today outside of my cabin he was naked and he had a rock.. He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish he must be insane.. I remember when I was like that.I still am in a way.Day 7I don't know what to do.The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep he held a rock to my head and struck..My life flashed before my eyes stupid reflex I grabbed my journal.Remember when I said that I was coming home?

64451,2015-07-07,19,121,1,False,Not Recommended,There's a lot of hype surrounding this game and I know people can be defensive about new releases that they love. Before you judge this review helpful or not please read it instead of crucifying me based upon my recommendation of this game.Rocket League is essentially football with cars. There's actually a Top Gear episode that is pretty much exactly this game minus the rocket boosters! Two teams of between 1 and 4 players face off against each other and try to score as many goals in a 5 minute period using their custom vehicles to hit the ball and each other around the field.This game is undoubtedly a lot of fun. The physics are funny the cars drive well (though the rocket boost flying is tricky as all hell) it looks beautiful it runs fantastically at least for me so it certainly seems to be very well optimised and I've had no frame rate issues so far. Surprisingly they also didn't screw up the UI which is a very common mistake.So if all I'm doing is heaping praise on Rocket League why aren't I recommending it? Unfortunately there is simply not enough content to justify a 15 price. Sure there are tons of customisation options for your vehicle and they are absolutely great and really make you unique. The problem is there's only one arena to play in and after 2 or 3 games it becomes very very same y. Sure there are different skins for the arena and day/night versions but they don't change the gameplay at all. And really petty though it may seem that's all that's keeping me from recommending it.At first I honestly believed this was an Early Access title and that more would be added soon. I feel as though this game might have benefited from a free to play model with cosmetic microtransactions though it's hard to gauge how effective that may have been.I would compare this game to the Mario Strikers series as both are a kind of zany take on football. I know it's unfair to compare a AAA title from a Mario series to Rocket League but I think the developers could have taken some great inspiration from Mario Strikers Charged. Power ups characters with different abilities and hazardous arenas ensured that each game played very differently and was wildly unpredictable. To me that's what Rocket League is missing and why I can play Mario Strikers Charged again and again but got bored of Rocket League within the hour. To anyone that's played Rocket League so far imagine this one player presses a button in the arena and for a limited time the sides of the arena only reflect the ball. Players can fall and be knocked off the sides into the abyss. I think you get the picture more inventive arena design really would have helped this game.Recommending and not recommending is a thin line though so while on the whole I would not tell me friends to pick this up some people might enjoy this. If you and your friends intend on playing a couple of games every now and then then you may well enjoy this a lot. If however you're looking to sink more than a few hours a week into a multiplayer game then I do not believe this is for you.Essentially I would compare this game to a dolled up version of Air Hockey because that's really what it is. For what it is it's great and a lot of fun but for me and I imagine a lot of other people that fun ran out extremely quickly. Perhaps DLC will add in what this game is currently missing but for now I cannot recommend it at this price.5/10P.S. If you do get this game please please make sure you have a controller. It shouldn't have to be said but just in case racing games on keyboard/mouse are awkward and poor to play and you'll have a sub standard experience. I've been using the Xbox controller and it's worked great for me. If you have a different controller try to find information on if/how it works with this game.,Rocket League®

Spawning crap to block the road freezing you deleting your weapons (its temporary don't worry) spawning money (because everything is expensive) and also trying to crash your game by spawning alot of stuff if you want to report them.. could be better for the modding communityStill a great game and I think the number of hackers have reduced by now.,Grand Theft Auto V

3,2018-06-14,126,1086,676,False,Recommended,Out of all the reviews I wrote This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. I wonder if anyone actually read this review I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!,Dead by Daylight

121851,2016-08-30,1,3,341,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V. Rockstars latest release. A game filled with action fun and comedy from time to time. GTA V takes us back to Los Santos where GTA San Andreas was set. From the last installment in the GTA franchise we see some improvements and some letdowns. But of course this is just me comparing the two and giving my own opinion. Also I will try keep this as spoiler free as possible.Pros 1. You now have 3 charcters to play with. Franklin an african american who lived his life in the hoods and now wants a change. Michael a criminal who faked his death in a bank job in front of his best friend to make it out with money and then move to sunny LS after living in the cold hard conditions of North Yankton. Which brings me on to Trevor a psychopathic drug addict who is hunting down for his best friend that faked his murder.2. Adding on to the first pro is that now during missions containing more than two of the protagonists you can switch between them whenever you see fit. During missions heists and whilst roaming about!(BEWARE YOU MIGHT FIND TREVOR WEARING A SKRT OR SLEEPING ON THE EDGE OF A BRIDGE)3. Better graphics and optimization in gameplay than on GTA IV.4. Little touches that make you appreciate the game more such as Improved gun sounds (Compared to IV) Car makes beeping noise when door open whilst engine running car engine makes little cracking sound when enine turned off and many many more.5. Online. Now as I see it online is its own game. GTA online is its own little experience meeting new players racing doing online heists and deathmatches are a thing. 6. Rockstar have decided to keep the DLC free in fear of ripping apart the community. The downside is that the stuff they add is usually like duper cars or other expensive vehicles. The problem is that they cost way too much and you would need to invest in ingame currency.7. The modding community. The modding community is awesome and very helpful.Now this part I hate doing. But here guys are the cons.1. Online modders and hackers dropping you money you try leaving before uts too late. But you still get banned.2. Shortest story in the franchise. The story mode is amazing. But it is the shortest and some saying that it is the worst in the franchise.3. The physics are flawed. Anyone who has played GTA IV and GTA V will see and acknowledge the differences between the two games in the way the physics work. In GTA IV you felt like you actually had a heavy or a light car which hanles differently. Also the collisions are a lot more realistic than in GTA V because you can actually see the damage on both cars. Where as in GTA V you can bearly see any cosmetic damage. Also you cant get by 80mph. I dont k know why but you cant. Though there is a semi realistic physics which brings back some of the GRA IV physics.4. The price. I bought this game on 25%off sale. And i dont think its worth full price. But I guess if you really want to go agead. You know what youre getting. Cough* Cough* no mans sky.ConclusionDo I reccomend this game? Yes. Although ot took a long time too decide I think its worth it. Although the physics arent as good and the story isnt that long I still believe it is a good game.

No Capcom you absolute wafflestompers your little EULA doesn't supercede EU law.Oh I almost forgot to mention it's also plagued by the SSD eating Anti Consumer virus ""Denuvo"" collecting your Steam ID your unique hardware IDs and God knows what else which you can not block or opt out of. Automatic harvesting of your data without consent. Neat. You may also enjoy watching this https //www.youtube.com/watch?v ByfLg9wGB4oThose are quite the risky moves. Violating the rights of tens of thousand EU citizens wouldn't be something I'd be comfortable with but look at the big balls on Capcom. Speaking of balls my crystal ball predicts hectic days at their legal office when every Data Protection Agency from the EEA sends them their regards generating enough energy from personally accountable CEO's stressed breathing and rivers of sweat to power a middle sized city.It's amazing to watch history unfold in front of your eyes to see presumably lost basic human rights like the right to privacy finally get wrestled from out of bounds greedy medieval corporate overlords' hands. Never did it feel so good to be a downtrodden petty farmer tending your digital crops while watching the capitalist feudal castles burn to the ground.So this is what the French Revolution felt like heads rolling like a Chamillionaire themed drag race.

243047,2018-03-26,1,2,401,False,Not Recommended,I have approximatley 280hours on this game. The game is fun in concept however in actual execution it is a broken POS.Lag and latencey issues are terrible and un avoiadable. You can be shot at run several meters behind cover and then seconds later the hits will register and you lose health or die. Gun play is never consistant due to variences in server latency. Lag in the beginning of the game even makes it difficult to pick up critical items. Its very frusrating when this is always present and you don't really get to enjoy the game for what it is.Cheating is huge and it seems like the developers don't mind it. Get used to being killed by people with digits as a name who hip fire headshots at 200 meters.The game was much funner in the beginning of early access. Unfortuanly the developers are in a virtual urinating contest with fort nite so you will see more useless features added (the emoji system) rather then the real gameplay issues being addressed. This WAS the best battle royal. Thankfully battle royal games are the flavor of the week and another good one will be around soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I immidiatly falled in love with the Battle Royal concept being on a plane with 99 other guys and know that only one of us would still be standing up at the end of the game. The first time I played the game (the day of the release) I remember that I had that feeling telling myself ""this is huge"" .... The last time in my life I had a such great feeling was the first time I played Counter Strike (Alpha version) back in 1999 I told myself this game is special. Ok to be honest I may have told myself the same thing the first time I played GTA... But honnestly I haven't played any game in my life that much I played Counter Strike and I am quite sure that PUBG is here for a long time. What I love with PUBG is that I can run a game in solo whenever I want to play and I don't need to rely on any third people... Random teamates use to be a mess... I love even more when I play the game in squad with some friends and that's what initially loved in Counter Strike the team play.Now many people complain about this game at the eSport level being too random... I agree that that part is still a problem at a high competition level but when it come to have fun you will for sure enjoy this game for a long time.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
391434,2017-05-21,2,4,9,True,Not Recommended,"The single worst designed game I've ever played.Set aside the community for a moment as for any survival game it's bound to be toxic. The game's optimization is a joke and no ""Early Access"" excuse is going to justify that. On a GTX 1050 and FX 6300 setup that can run DOOM at 60 FPS 1080p on high Battlefield 1 at 60 FPS on Medium 1080p this game constantly stutters and runs no higher than 30 FPS on the lowest settings. My setup isn't the best but this game doesn't even look that great. Gameplay's worse. After the needlessly long loading screens the game spawns you in the complete worst places possible this game is what spawned the ""noob beach"" slang and it certainly exemplifies it. The ""Wounded"" system is one of the worst parts of dying bar none 9 times out of 10 you'll be left to die by your assailant and it will take you 1 minute to actually die. In EVERY OTHER survival game I've played once your health is zero you die and that's how it should be. The system just serves to waste your time especially since no ""suicide"" option exists to simply end the torture.The AI is also abysmal. Animals will constantly stop and turn at a 90 degree angle toward another direction. Some like bears totally ignore you even if you're in their line of sight. Traps do not serve any purpose either with the traps doing little to the animals.UI is sluggish combat is sluggish game itself runs at a sluggish framerate. This game is the definition of sluggish.If you'd like to play a survival game that's actually worth your time Minecraft (the game that popularized the damn genre) Unturned and hell even DayZ will give you bang for your buck.

Facepunch studios (creators of Rust) do the things right in the fastest way possible they listen to what the players are asking to fix in this fantastic game take the c4 exploit as an example but if you dont know what it is then lets get right to it. the c4 exploit is where you can get a ton by meaning a ton is lets say millions of c4 (raiding tools) which in us rust players were really bad but the good thing was that its fixed in very little time meaning ""they do the right things in the fastest way possible"". this game is really fun when you get your hands on the mechanics of the game or lets say when you have learned the basics on how the game works BUT i do suggest to have friends be playing with you if you dont then maybe when a server has restarted you could ask a player for some teamwork but a neutral amount of players are very greedy and want to kill you and snatch all your loot and resources. but in my case i was a friendly guy and when someone asked for teamwork i was very polite and said ""me"". and that was the time where i met my friend named Zach so far i think Rust can train your social skills and teamwork with other people by playing this game and by this last sentence i now answer the question ""Do i recommend this game?"" and the answer is YES and why? because the game is very fun to play in a very cheap price but it can be very dissapointing when you get killed or either raided. and thats why i said in the very beginning that this is for players who like a challenge.",Rust

Don't get me wrong it's a lot of fun but that fun is often killed with minor stuff.My first problem is that I often see someone hit a ball deflects it in other direction and after a split second it resets and follows the previous path. This is enough to confuse you and miss the otherwise easy ball. This happens once or twice in every to games to me.Second problem I'm having is ranks in matchmaking. Just to set things straight I'm playing ranked 2v2 with my friend both same rank and division and both pretty much the same level.BEFORE last update which introduced crates we were constantly getting opponents whos combined rank was 2 3 ranks above ours which was sometimes a problem.NOW I don't have this problem but last few games I had opponents that had below 15 hours had Semi Pro level and were solid 3 ranks above us which played a lot better than us. I'm not saying I'm perfect in fact I'm not even good but playing against these is like playing against blue ranks (which is admirable).Plus a minor annoyance which is not being able to select which maps you can play because some people don't like Neo Tokyo map. The traction on some surfaces is very odd and feels like the walls on every map have some special coding just to hold the car on it.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes.

29886,2018-09-16,2,3,10,False,Not Recommended,"&lt 2 hours play review keep that in mind if you read )I honestly do not understand why this game is gaining such fandom on the PC but each to their own I guess. I review this as a SINGLE PLAYER experience. The graphics are very disappointing. On a high end PC 4k textures are usually standard. These ported console graphics simply look quaint like a children s cartoon. Animation lacks enough frames and looks sloppy like an old Streetfighter game on SNES. Voice acting is sparse. Most of the time you are reading text with the occasional ""over here"" or ""huh"" being voiced. It kills immersion especially as the NPC lips keep moving as if the voice is there. Lip sync when it is there is hilariously bad. You know Half Life 2 got this right in 2004 right? Path finding is horrible unless you already know where to go. Map markers ( firefly guidance ) don t always work if the destination is higher or lower. This is frustrating especially as every 30 seconds someone barks over here . It honestly made me hit my keyboard in frustration. Combat is laughable on Keyboard and Mouse. I cannot use a controller due to a disability so must use a keyboard and mouse. I m used to companies ignoring the disabled but this game still thinks it s on a controller. You end up constantly trying to relock your target or desperately trying to aim your weapon in the hope of hitting something. All the while trying to dodge using the space key and WSAD. Unfortunately this only works about 40% of the time.Despite losing 60 on this poorly ported dross I m going to retire this game. I can t stand the frustration any longer. If console ports are going to happen developers should at least port them properly and respect the new audience.Let me go off slightly off topic and also justify my negative bias I am disappointed with STEAM who refused a refund claiming I'd played this for &gt 2 hours. This is a suspect measurement STEAM claimed &gt 8 hours playing when I'd only owned the game for under 6. (I d actually played 1hr 40 minutes). According to UK law they should refund anyway but apparently STEAM do not respect UK law! If that is the case despite 14 years of purchases and tens of thousands of pounds spent I will finally retire STEAM and move to another platform which I genuinely find a sad way to part company.To think my time with STEAM all started so well with my purchase of Half Life 2 and ended so badly with this lazy cash grab.

122598,2015-06-14,17,7,180,False,Recommended,I purchased this video game for my 10 year old child for completing his communion. At first we could not figure out how to get the game to load on to his Macintosh laptop but after some time a Windows support representative told us that we could not install the game on Macintosh and had to purchase a Windows computer. I did not want to disappoint my child as I was afraid that he might question his faith if he did not reap the rewards of his hard work for Jesus. We purchased him an Official Dell Windows computer and started to install this video game for him. This is where things took a turn for the worse. When purchasing this game I was under the impression that I was buying my child a Police game where you would stop criminals as the title mentioned who were stealing cars. This game is not what I thought it was and I was appalled to learn that this game was the exact opposite of stopping criminals. You ARE the criminal. I stood there in horror as I watched my devout Christian child steal a car and shoot an automatic assaulting rifle at civilians. I then watched as he took this stolen vehicle and picked up a working girl and took her to a remote location and received favors in return for cash. What horrible person would create such an awful game where the main goal is to sin as much as possible?? This game should be called Grand Theft Satan. I would not recommend this game for any human to play. I had to go to church every day to help me forget the things that I witnessed in that game. As a proud conservative Christian mother I would HIGHLY recommend that this video game gets taken off of steam and the developers are sent to confession. If you want your child to have a soul I suggest you do not purchase this game. 1/10,Grand Theft Auto V

While initially appearing as mysterious and confused the protagonist is an incredibly one dimentional figure who does little else than loot dead bodies for valuables exploiting the unfortunate deaths of others not once coming to terms with their own mortality. In addition to this the supporting characters are bland murderous amalgamations of cowardice and hatred who fail to effectively convey the deeper meaning of this game. Although the storyline had great potential it was overshadowed by the vapid interactions between the unfaceted and unlikable characters.

122267,2015-05-05,1,15,64,False,Not Recommended,********ONLINE REVIEW**********First heres a note. The people that get banned are those who use mods in online play. If you mod in single player you have little chance to be banned as it does not effect everyone else in the game you are in. Those complaining about being banned are ignorant to the fact that they mess up the servers when they change their files around. This isnt minecraft.I don't recommend this game for online play currently with the amount of modders in the game right now the servers can get laggy. Not only that lots of the content can't be accessed because of the community. People give up after 1 failure in a heist which means you have to look for 3 MORE people to do the heist with again while losing all the progress you made on ur first attempt. It wouldn't be so bad if the load times weren't abysmal but having to wait another 2 mins after some A hole ruins ur fun and leaves is not worth the wait. I rate GTA Online a 4/10 It's great in theory but the execution is no where close to what it should be. Maybe when they fix the game up a bit I might recommend people play online.,Grand Theft Auto V

122211,2016-01-09,2,3,1644,False,Not Recommended,Long and constant loading screen with loads of cheaters. Literally every session has at least one cheater and they can do pretty much anything they want. Spawn fire under everyone? No problem they can do that. Spawn money under everyone? They can do that too. Do whatever they want? Oh yes.The shark cash card is a almost like a scam. Every session has a cheater in it and there's a good chance they're spamming money at you even if oyu don't ask or want it. So instead of buying money just ask or wait for one of those cheaters to throw money at you. Rockstar doesn't seem to care about it.I really don't recommend you buy this game. If you really want it wait for a really good sale and even then you might want to skip the game. The singleplayer is boring and multiplayer is full of cheaters who can do whatever they want and Rockstar isn't even trying to ban them.You won't believe how much control the cheaters have over the servers unless you see it.

123490,2015-05-06,5,33,106,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is an amazing game. The single player is an engaging and incredibly detailed piece of work which had me hooked for a long time over two platforms. From first person dashboard panels to puns and debris scattered around the city it will impress.Unfortunately the Online mode doesn't stack up so well as seen from extended time playing it. The world feels less alive and shallow compared to single player and suffers from a multitude of bugs that never should have made it past QA. Lobby crashes aren't uncommon strange design and UI choices make it clumsy to use and the activities are fragmented into a string of waiting rooms with broken lobby mechanics. It doesn't even have any wildlife making the world even more empty!The game also suffers from a crime and punishment system that doesn't work. Want to shoot someone chasing you? If you hit the explosives carried in their hand you get penalised and fined for destroying their car even if it wasn't your intention. Someone coming at you in an armoured car? Surely it makes sense to blow it up this time since it's bulletproof (especially for newer players) but instead you get penalised again. The developers expect you to shoot through a tiny vision slit to defend yourself which is heavily unbalanced against someone when they are caught out in the open by player killers giving little chance to fight back.Of particular note are the loading times. They are utterly horrendous and unacceptable in this day and age with the game commonly getting stuck on the loading screen. If you Shift+Tab to pass the time you find the game will refuse to load and silently get stuck in an infinite loop. This is especially terrible for a game two years old what's the excuse Rockstar?And last but not least the modding situation. Not too relevant to me as I don't use them but there is quite some controversy surrounding the banning of players for mods in a series that was heavily modded in past incarnations. Rockstar's treatment of players has been brought into question.(UPDATE Rockstar comment here http //www.rockstargames.com/newswire)Overall if you haven't played single player I'd pick this up. But due to the poorly performing multiplayer and bugs I won't be adding it to the recommendations list for anyone looking to go online.,Grand Theft Auto V

220613,2017-05-10,1,5,882,True,Not Recommended,"Edited for update Unfortunately this will be my last edit for a while until I hear through the grapevine this game has improved or I get fatalistically bored and play it. Steer clear from this game as is because the developer has no idea what he is doing with every subsequent patch where my lag issues have only gotten worse and hackers are more prevalent than ever. (I just ran into a guy who was able to delete the guns I was using. Think about that. As soon as I ran into his radius (I assume) my gun just disappeared. Happened to my co op partner. Sure it could be a bug but it did not look like a bug to me. Edited for update The current lag in this game has gotten worse with the most recent update. The amount of hackers has also skyrocketed. Every time I play this game I run into at least one guy. Hell I was playing Duo with a guy who was able to fire his gun underwater had unlimited ammo and could duplicate anything he picked up. I can't even stomach through what I once was able to enjoy. Definitely hold off on a purchase until this is resolved. I uninstalled the game after reporting hacks/cheats and receiving a WARNING from their forums for simply agreeing with someone that this game has massive hacking problems my first and last post. Original review I would like to recommend this game but I will not.There are lots of good things about this game but it comes down to really one major feature. Tension.Pro Tension like you wouldn't believe.Cons hackers (so far run into hackers that I know of over a half dozen times in two days.) latency issues Firing a full AKM clip into a guy before he goes down where as I take two shots as i'm dodging and am put down.Really those are the two cons.The latency issues can sometimes seem like ""hacking"" issues and frankly it'll be hard for a lot of people to tell the two apart I've had years of admin experience in FPS and consider myself somewhat of an old hand when it comes to realizing I've been stiffed.It can be fun but again I have the best internet possible in Chicago and playing in the NA server I'll be finding myself putting 5 headshots from behind into some guy only for him to turn around and destroy me. Instances like that will have you go ""lag or hack?""When this happens every other game its more than frustrating. Its a shame.If you are like me and get frustrated at these things this game will not be enjoyable.Here is an example of a frustrating match Landed in the military base managed to kill two people (one with my fists vs his pistol because pistols are god awful) and one with that very same pistol (P1911) into a prone looting guy in a corner. Pick up a M416 and a silencer. Then find a kar98 and kit that out. Find a Mil vest 3 and helmet 3 and various other goodies.Run across the bridge to the ne and find a crate falling from the sky. Camp the crate for two minutes and kill one guy with the kar as he is trying to loot the crate. Run up to crate and find the MG. Grab that and drop the m416 and run to a nearby buggy. Drive buggy to the center of the white ring and jump out. Find a second story building where I camp a door with no windows. Sit in room. Player numbers tick down from 60 40 30. I stay in the same room. 20 18. Same room. White circle moves to outside my room but still covers the building. I go to the other side and do the same thing for two minutes. White circle moves so I jump from the balcony to the floor and make it to another building where I repeat the same process. Now 15 left. 10. Sitting in room guy opens the door and I blast away at him with my MG. he just stands there looking at me. Then shoots me after I've finished firing 100 bullets close range into him. I die from one pistol shot despite having full armor/helmet 3. Yeah... no thanks.Half the frustration of this game comes from the incredible highs you get... to be undercut by what I mentioned is again a shame.It's possible this game will be worth playing in the future. I'll check up on it every now and then and update this review as necessary.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Let a goal in have a group of 10 year olds spamming ""What a save!"" in chat. Miss a shot the same group screaming ""Nice Shot!"". The salt becomes even saltier when they refuse to skip replays. I still can't understand why the hell Psyonix hasn't included the ability to remove post goal replays from online matches. The micro transaction system is rubbish. I've bought around 50 keys so far and it's just decal after decal that no one gives a damn about. I've bought all the DLC something recommend if you really want the advantage on the field with turning radius and hitbox advantage. Standard cars in the game are useless. Also don't get scammed by traders.Do not ever play 3v3 in ranked games. You will rage. Your teammates will be useless and will blame you for losing. Even if you carry the team in a loss scoring all the goals and doing all the defending they will find a reason to blame you. Doubles and solo are recommended. Psyonix had potential to make this game great but even something as small as the animation in trying to control the car or flip it after you've fallen off a wall or gone into a wall just takes too long which opens a massive window for goal scoring.

29098,2018-10-10,2,3,2,False,Not Recommended,"I really really wanted to enjoy this game. I was expecting a vastly different experience than what I got.Character creation is alright. Got through it with minimal difficulty although it's a bit hard for your character not to look like a goblin. Just made the Palico resemble my cat like I'm sure a ton of other people did.The first big red flag for me was the part just off the ship. I'm presented with a fairly obvious path I test it and find I can't fall down or off somewhere I'm not supposed to go and that's fine. But good god as soon as I turn the camera all hell breaks loose. It did not help that the design choice for this particular bit was the same or very similar 'VERY HOT VOLCANO' texture ing. EVERYWHERE.Okay fine. Got through that and jumped off the big boi. Now I'm in the jungle and yep the camera's just as . My character is a bit slow but I assume that's just because hey tutorial I don't have most of my controls yet. Yeah.Nah. You move like you're carrying bricks in your underwear and you best be deliberate with where you're going lest you get punked by some monsters. The problem with such clunky movement and camera controls though is that when you're up against a big monster or even a horde of little guys they're both a ton more nimble than you are. Maybe there's upgrades for this? I didn't want to bother playing any further to find out. The combat was unintuitive and I didn't even get a prompt telling me how to attack until AFTER I had been trying every button figuring out how to unsheathe my weapon figuring out how to put it away by accident getting it back out and finally attacking these little rat bastards that are orbiting me all the while and while all of this is going on the NPCs are shouting at me to use potions and items attack a certain thing run here run there Just. Stop. For a ing second. This game throws WAY too much at you from the outset. I appreciate having a wide diversity of weapons and attack methods to choose from but why the hell do you dump 16 choices on a brand new player and expect them to make an informed decision? Sure you get a brief summary of what each weapon does plus a video showing the attacks but come on. Am I really supposed to just try all of these at some point replying missions until I get to pick my favorite? Why not just have these weapons be unlocked via progression of similar playstyles? Light / Heavy / Ranged. Nothing is less helpful than the absolute shantytown cluster of a town they dump you into either. While I can appreciate the seeming intention of ""Hey we crashed a boat here and built on a mountain"" aesthetic why make the goddamn one safe point we've been to so far a challenge in of itself? ""The lifts help you get around."" Which lift? There's pulleys and moving everywhere and the minimap is so minimally helpful because you have layers of wood and rope and canvas covering up everything. No graphical settings could compensate for this god awful design. Which by the way when your UI in a mission unironically resembles a meme image of ""modern shooters"" with icons and flashing and text and instructions ING EVERYWHERE It's a bad UI. I could guess at what my health and stamina was but the rest of what I was looking at so made little goddamn sense.I put the game down at the end of the first mission when I couldn't even stick around to explore or butcher the corpses of my kills.Maybe this game would be fun to Monster Hunter vets who can deal with a console port but for someone who has had no experience in the series Monster Hunter World was an absolute turn off.I refunded my purchase on Oct 10th 2018 after two whopping hours of confusing obtuse gameplay.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

361474,2013-12-24,17,11267,13,True,Recommended,"After around an hour and a half of bad spawns scarce resources and short lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and upon the realization that neither of us were hostile we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot on sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course he comes around sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then to add even more of an insult he adds an apology at the end as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting half naked unprepared players. All in all though I do see a lot of potential in this game and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",Rust

433733,2016-11-03,1,11,309,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Not recommended because again Bethesda relies on other people to fix another one of their top products. I can manage with small bugs annoyances etc. but 1. Not being able to walk through open doors essentially preventing me from finishing quests without the use of the console or mods. Collisions are broken all around.2. Barnabas is EVEN MORE annoying which is almost impossible or so i thought.3. Random objects NPCs and animals can often be found floating in the air.4. Essenntially all of the original vanilla Skyrim bugs are transferred along with introducing new ones.(5. No achievements with or without mods or addons. EDIT I have not touched the game for a few days and suddently the achievements magically appeared go figure.)I'm sick of spending time fixing games instead of playing them. Considering that Fallout 4 is essentially Skyrim with guns and both games were released prior to Skyrim SE I thik Bethesda should do a better job working on a product rather than marketing it. After Thief 2014 i stopped bying Square Enix titles where you spend more time watching opening and closing windows rather than playing. Looks like my blacklist will be expading soon unless there are major improvemets in this product (Skyrim SE). Until then this review will stay negative.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition

8176,2017-08-21,1,2,3443,False,Not Recommended,"Dead By Daylight is a great game in theory. If you have friends you can have fun playing as survivors or if you have no friends or life you can be a killer. The game involves a lot of grinding. The game is terribly balanced and is immensely stacked in the killers favour. The killers whine to the developers that survivors (particularily survivors who are friends in teamspeak) are overpowered leading to constant buffs for killers. In addition to this killers are usually bad people who will camp your body once you get hooked resulting in you dying before anything even happens in your match. The killers are able to hook you quickly due to cheap ""perks"" such as Iron Grasp Insidious A Nurses Calling and many more. Often the killer won't even hook you but will straight up kill everyone in the first 5 minutes using a ""Mori"" which is a cheap offering people use to kill survivors outright. The idea that survivors are OP in any way shape or form is so laughable it made me uninstall. I did have fun in my over 300 hours playing this game but only against killers who weren't bad people. When you have to leave it up to the nature of the player to determine how others will enjoy the game it's not balanced. If in the future the developers figure out a way to punish killers for camping hooks I may return to the game. I would not recommend the game to people unless you like grinding and getting dicked by unsporting ""killers"".Edit Oh yeah. I forgot to mention there is no way to block or dodge toxic killers in this game. And the BEST PART of DBD is the fact that your save data will spontaneously delete itself. Yeah. You have to manually go into your files and create a back up save file every time you exit the game unless you want your data to be randomly deleted.Edit The new Freddy Kreuger DLC for this game was fun at first but is now mind numbingly unfun and boring. The only counters to Freddy are SWF and pallet looping the two things that were already a problem in the game. On top of that Freddy has cheap add ons where a survivor will literally spawn into the match already in the dream world. The survivor just spawns in and is already being punished with half efficiency action speed AND having their aura visible to the killer. And the Freddy DLC being released on Double Blood points week just ruins it as every match is Freddy and they all want to slug you to death. Want to play Killer? Just have to wait 15 minutes to get a lobby since literally everyone is playing Freddy right now.Edit Killer EditionThis game is literally broken. The Killer is supposed to be the power role but it is actually the survivors that hold the power. Voice communications aren't built into the game and it wasn't balanced around survivors being able to communicate. But using third party software that is exactly what survivors do.One survivor can run the killer around the map using what are known as ""pallet loops"" and ""semi infinites"". Running in circles around pallets and vaulting through windows a survivor can literally run the killer around the entire map while their team is completing generators (all 5 of which can be completed in a matter of minutes if you aren't applying pressure). If they have an OP perk called Decisive Strike they will probably escape again. You may spend an entire match chasing 1 survivor who might escape you and teabag you at the exit gate. Basically to win as a killer at high ranks you rely on survivors making mistakes and that's not something they will do very often unless they are BOOSTED or inebriated. With the current change to the victory system killers must secure a certain numbr of hooks/deaths to rank up although survivors don't have to survive to rank up. If you're gonna play killer in this metagame don't expect to get any kills and if you do you will get harassed called a camper told to kill yourself etc because that is what this community is. The killer isn't feared. If you play killer you are literally submitting yourself for the survivors entertainment at your expense (basically you are a clown). UNLESS you play 1 of 3 killers and you are good with them (Nurse Billy or Huntress) you may stand a chance. All in all the only fun you will get out of this game is playing survivor and trolling the killer. Just remember there is a real human being controlling that killer and they probably aren't having as much fun as you.2 years on and the games progress can STILL randomly delete itself. That means starting over from scratch. Even if you have a backup of your save file and you send it to the devs they are too incompetent to do anything other than refund bloodpoints. If you had a legacy or rare cosmetic skin you are out of luck. Devs are corrupt and give out legacy skins to people they know and close friends like the community manager it's a disgrace. The point of legacy is it is supposed to be earned.",Dead by Daylight

TL DRBeing quick is an essential part of the game so let me give you a fast overview PositiveMediocreNegative+ Fun for beginner intermediate and pro but sometimes very frustrating + Loads of cool mechanics take a lot of time to learn + great car and item variety a lot has to be unboxed traded or bought + Great arena designs some may lag on older systems + Cool and fresh soundtracks some might not like environmental sounds Manual and Automatic Report/Ban features toxic community+ regular huge awesome and free updates The GuideI will put the main part of this review into a steam guide the foremost reason is that there is far too much I want to talk about.To justify making it a guide review I will put a lot of reference to it and go into more detail so I hope you can accept my decision and enjoy it regardless.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 947564753The VerdictThe game is designed to be pure fun for everybody and it achieves this goal with flying marks.A definite recommendation for just about anyone coming by trust me that you can have fun without investing a ton of time.Just mind that it's a big online game and like any other of the size it attracts trolls plain idiots and other sorts of human scum so do yourself a favor and disable voice and maybe text chat in the options and you are good to go.

116696,2015-05-07,1,5,430,False,Not Recommended,My review is largely predicated on Online since that's touted as the major feature of this game.I will say that if you want to pick this game up solely on the strengths of SP you should by all means do so since I haven't had this much fun with a GTA since San Andreas or Vice City. It's certainly a far better port than IV was.Indeed if I'm just talking about single player it is a fantastic game. Each character has a great deal of personality and watching them interact with each other throughout the course of the story is amazing.Roaming around the city even after the story is complete is still enjoyable because there are all the fun sidequests (or Strangers and Freaks as they're known in game) collectibles and other things to get ahold of.I will say that it's irksome that it's so difficult to get income (particularly compared to San Andreas where I was able to amass a nice fortune through silly horse betting) but once you have money on hand it's great to just tear around the city. I wish Online was anything like this fun but sadly the desire to monetize online with the Shark Cards means it will never be that way.That being said Online in and of itself is a wonderful concept.I say this with a pinch of salt mostly because the times I've found it wonderful were when I was playing it alone with no one else on the server.As it is you're almost always relegated to playing it with other people which is terrible. Griefers abound whose sole purpose in life seems to be existing just to kill you blow up your vehicles and generally make themselves a complete ing inconvenience. This is somehow less awful than when they start a heist with you because at least if they kill you you respawn. If they play through almost an entire heist or setup only to quit 30 seconds from the ending with nary but a 'HAVE FUN DOING THIS AGAIN' just before they leave and force you to lose all your progress because you have to have every last ing slot full to play a heist for God knows what ing reason you lose all your faith in humanity. It is events like that that make you understand why God is dead. God is dead because he killed himself because he realized what he thought were his finest creations were largely composed of the very worst examples of evil you could ever imagine.Were there the opportunity to simply do all of the content alone or with a carefully curated selection of 'my friends' and nobody else Online would be amazing. As it is it's a terrible festival of the very worst of humanity and it is only the fact that I really want to get through to Pacific Standard that keeps me returning to the game despite the fact that you cannot find a public group worth a damn because they fail given the slightest opportunity and when you do find said group invariably one of them will mock you and quit before the end.Sartre was right. Hell is other people and they all run around in Los Santos.,Grand Theft Auto V

29849,2018-12-29,2,2,3,False,Not Recommended,"1) Terrible PC controls. Maybe I should've expected this as a console port. But the controls are just terrible. Sure there's a learning curve expected with every game but I don't want to have to hit a 15 button combo to just to use a basic attack on a creature. Controls are very clunky non intuitive and just downright confusing. Friends who have a console controller seem to have a better time but not always. One guy with a controller had to spend 5 minutes figuring out how to investigate a foot print.2) Multiplayer is an afterthought. You can't do any story quests as multiplayer without having to do a workaround of ensuring that 1 person has done the quest and everyone else on the quest has seen the cutscenes. Who TF cares about cutscenes? I can tell you that the majority of players do not. It's annoying AF and there is no way to skip them. The other quests it took me and 3 other people 2 hours to figure out how to get into a party and do a quest together. After we did that one quest (collect mushrooms) we basically weren't able to do the next quests together. 3) Nothing in this game is intuitive.. Why am I out hunting monsters? Sure the game is called ""Monster Hunter"" but there should be meaning to why I'm out slaughtering everything that moves. Oh that mob is just standing there making a nest non aggro. GO KILL IT AND THEN GO BACK TO MAKE A NEW WEAPON DURRR.. Oh I can research a new weapon or armor.. all I need is this item ??? and I need ??? amount of it.. literally it just has ???. Oh the mobs drop ammo when you hit them? That makes sense..... Maybe the game gets better after the 4 hours I invested into it? I doubt it though. I like a challenge I don't need to be hand held (like the fireflies that point you towards everything you can interact with) but I like there to be something else aside from monsters just running from me 10 times when they get low hp.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

28787,2018-09-14,1,6,255,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR This is the worst mainline Monster Hunter game and worse than some of the spin offs. The more I play the older ones the more reasons I see they are better. It's still a fun game but I would recommend the other games in the series instead. Also it's a bad port with denuvo.I started playing the Monster Hunter series in MH3 and have played all of the english releases that came out since then (except stories). I honestly would have never purchased MHWorld if it didn't have a Monster Hunter label on it. I would have seen that it had mixed reviews and moved on. Its still a fun game by itself and i'll play a bit more of it probably but it's not a good Monster Hunter game. If you have a console to play any of the other Monster Hunter games go do that instead. They are better but they are also harder. There are a few major improvements to World but there are also a lot of negative changes. A lot of the things they did almost make it seem like they were trying to separate the game from the series in which it's in but this is supposed to be a mainline game not a spin off so that doesn't make any sense. At first I thought I was just being hard on World cause it was so different. The more I play Generations Ultimate the more I realize World actually is worse than almost all other Monster Hunter games. I realize MHGenerations is technically a spin off but it's much more similar to Monster Hunter than World is. It still plays the same as the mainline games it's just made by a different team and the ""specialized tool"" concept in world seems to be inspired by the ""arts"" in Generations.Some of the improvements are The biggest improvement is no loading screens between areas.It's on PC.The graphics are better ... except where it matters. More on this in negatives.Gathering isn't a pain.Minor quality of life improvements.You can see damage numbers now.Training area helps with min maxing damage I guess.The negatives Denuvo DRM. DRM only hurts the consumer.Monsters can go to sleep right in front of you even though you just almost killed them. WHY?! What happened to all the stealth stuff they added? I just almost took its life and all of a sudden it doesn't care that I am now IN ITS HOME. A lot of the time when fighting flying wyverns like Rathalos when they fly away to sleep I fast travel to the camp in the tree and get to the nest long before I can even see the wyvern from it. It then lands and sleeps right next to me while I am standing right there in the nest on it's eggs.Can't pause the game mid quest anymore even in offline mode.No option to turn off scoutflies.More unfair ""difficulty"". Mostly roars and such sometimes last long enough you can get hit during them by the monster causing them. Also can no longer button mash out of stun.Dash juice no longer negates stamina use. It also doesn't last long enough for and is too expensive for halving stamina use.No option to turn off auto signal when you see a monster in multiplayer. It's literally pointless. Everyone shares the monster location info. Everyone has an eye next to their name when they are fighting a large monster.The ""specialized tools"" concept was done much better in generations. You had ""arts"" that were attacks or buffs that usually had really cool animations. Now it's just a cloak that's it. Their re use was charged by hitting the monster a lot and not some set cooldown so they were almost like a reward for doing well rather than a ""cheat"" for being bad at the game.They completely destroyed the armor system. I woudn't even care because its not a bad armor system now but it was better before. It was more unique and the skills themselves weren't sliced into so many levels that the first few levels were worthless. I suppose this new one can still be puzzle like though and it might grow on me eventually except the slicing up skills. In the other games you needed to reach a certain threshhold of points in a skill for it to actually take effect and there were also negative skills that could cause problems if you didn't get rid of one of the points for it. An example of slicing the levels up is the attack boost skill. It had 3 levels until 4U which had a fourth stronger level. In World there are 7 levels. The first few are useless. In the other games the levels give +10 ak +15 atk +20 atk and in 4U onwards +25 atk. In World the levels give +3 atk +6 atk +9 atk +12 atk and +5% crit chance +15 atk and 5% crit chance +18 atk and 5% crit chance and +21 atk and 5% crit chance. +3 attack is literally 1% 2% boost to strong weapons. That's all it might as well not exist.Light bowguns were made less fun. They typically have a special burst fire for some ammo types depending on the gun. They types of ammo that were burst fired by each gun varied greatly. Now most burst the same thing as 3 or 4 of the other guns and it tends to be the boring weak shots. The element bowguns usually will fire only the element shot in burst and thats it if even that. They also removed blast shots and I don't have a clue why.Bows all play the same now. While you are readying an arrow they charge through different levels. They used to do different types of shots at each charge level. Now they are all the same.Zorah Magdaros fight feels horribly unfinished for many reasons. I really wish I had more space to go into detail.The story dialogue and characters are trash. The story was never great in monster hunter games but this is the worst in the series. The characters are boring and have no character. There used to be plenty of fun puns and a variety of characters and tiny side stories.The graphics are better ... except where it matters.Annoying zooming animation when looking at quest board. Should be no animation at all.Harder to see ailment effects being applied.Hitboxes seem worse.Lots of people seem to have trouble running this game. I have an AMD Ryzen 1600 Nvidia 1060 3gb and 16gb RAM. That's not a bad setup really but of course not the best. Usually I get 60 fps with mid low settings. Anti aliasing and volumetric rendering are turned off completely. I still drop to 40 50 in some portions of the Rotten Vale and Kushala Daora will near the end of its fight drop my fps to an unplayable 15 20. Teostra will sometimes drop it down to 30 40 with all his particles. There is no option to reduce particle effects. I watched my task manager one time and it seems like my CPU is used a lot by this game. That doesn't really make any sense to me considering there's not actually that much going on in this game. It definitely is not optimized well but I also wonder if Denuvo has something to do with it. I have no idea how that DRM works though so I can't say.Weapon designs lack variety. There used to be all sorts of crazy weapons. Now they just slap parts on the normal ones.I like the old mounting mechanic more because its UI is more informative. You are supposed to just stab the monster until you get a big hit and it falls over except that there seems to be no reason as to when you actually make the monster fall over. Supposedly the ring around the map is supposed to be an indicator closer to empty closer to fall. I've had many times where I did a big hit and it fell over while it was almost full many times when no big hit was done at all and a few times I got two big hits on it before it fell over. You have to brace sometimes but the indicator for this is solely vignette. I hate vignettes. The camera is always in a bad place when you are mounted and is worse when firing the slinger while mounted. In other games you had an actual bar on screen telling you how well you were doing exactly how close you were to making it fall and the time to brace was communicated to the player in a clear way. I have more but I'm out of space.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

Be that cars boats helicopters jets weapons or clothes you're always after something new.Yes there are ""lobbies"" with much higher level players in there ""destroying"" us newer players but they're not that frequent. Even when in one you'll have some enjoyment getting your revenge (or go into ""Passive Mode"").While I brought the game for the 'Story Mode' I'm finding myself focusing more on the Online play.There's some issues with lobbies randomly being ""emptied"" (in short you are moved into your own empty lobby due to the Rockstar Servers claiming your rig or connection can't handle the current lobby) but you can still join ""Jobs"" with others no problem.In short I'd highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone.It's great fun has humour and is excellent value for money.",Grand Theft Auto V

It made me realize how gaming industry nowaday start to get very cheaper and how innovation start to wilther away like an old flower.

It's like trying to escort a drunk friend home. You might run into an infinite loading screen bug like I did but the hour it takes to resolve that you'll be rewarded by getting to access the GTAV Online where you'll be armed with a 12 shot pistol and experience the joy of being spawn killed by people toting machine guns in souped up vehicles. If this happens when you were trying to reach an objective no worries you'll (very helpfully) respawn 100 000 years away from your waypoint and build character and patience by being killed (again) on your way there and spawning across the map (again).Despite this the game is still loads of fun. Or I would assume it is since people are still playing it. I wouldn't know because after playing online for about 1.5 hours I logged out. And about two hours after that Rockstar sent me an email telling me I was banned for a month.

29442,2018-09-01,1,2,7,False,Not Recommended,Well this is one of those reviews that I honestly wish there was some sort of a neutral button. I love RPG games in general and Monster hunter has a great idea with this one. However this game just seem unfinished and needs a lot of improvement . What's great 1. love the terrain and the monster bios as well as the ability to craft and upgrade your potions weapons and armor. 2. The story line is also fun to follow and allows tons of interaction between you and NPCs.What's garbage 1. The party system! While we got it figured out after a while there was no easy way to party up. You had to join up via steam group be sure you were all in the same session then join a posted mission. (and you need a party in this game! forget solo)2. Game mechanics. May not be too bad when using a controller but using KB and mouse is a surreal nightmare.3. Combat is clunky Like your character is moving in mud you need to resharpen your weapon mid combat and also you can't seem to pivot while fighting. I was using a katana. I had to stop fighting to turn and face the beast then re engage. If it ran past me I have to repeat. because you just can't seem to turn I think i ended up swinging at the air just as much as the monster.While I believe the game has great potential it just seems that they recoded the PS4 version to play on PC and ignored optimization completely. The game has freat promise but needs some help. At this point in time 5/10. I may revisit this is the combat system and maneuverability get's fixed. While I can't really recommend this game right now It's worth picking it up if it goes on sale for 30+% off.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD

28629,2018-08-28,2,2,211,False,Not Recommended,"TLDR If you love grindy loot games enough to forgive bad mechanics and a terrible pc port then this game is for you. Otherwise skip it.PROS Pretty. Great monster designs (Visuals/Animations/Attacks). Very smooth difficulty curve through the main story.CONS Literally everything else. You fight the camera as much as the monsters. Many of the items (weapons/armor) aren't distinct enough to warrant being in the game. Hit boxes are ridiculously oversized. Riddled with movement/fight mechanic inconsistencies such as jumping off of ledges and where your ""super"" moves line up during animations...sometimes they clearly miss yet hit other times they clearly hit yet no damage registers. Movement is more like driving a car than moving a person. Roar/Shockwave/Wing Flapping all stun you and can be done repeatedly Less actual play time and less engaging fights. Numerous monsters tend to make a b line away from you causing you to spend an inordinate amount of time running after them instead of actually fighting Less actual play time and less engaging fights. No animation canceling leaves the game feeling sluggish. This is compounded by the input delay problems. I'm not sure if this is a pc port issue or purely game design. To make matters worse starting mid game many monsters will just run back and forth as an attack pattern. So unless you are ranged you are just standing back and waiting for the pattern to end before going in to continue the fight. This unnecessarily breaks up the flow of fights (Along with the repeated stuns). Other monsters can join in which means you then have to use Dung Pods and hit them to make them run away or you'll be attacked by 2 monsters. This typically means you get roar stunned over...and over...and over again. So instead of focusing on adding abilities that actually relate to offense and defense you now have to add in skills to deal with repeated stuns. Btw there are deminishing returns on the hardest versions of monsters (""tempered monsters"") yet never deminishing returns on players. Every time you want to talk to a vendor you have to sit through the same couple lines of nonsense talk before accessing menus. It gets old fast. Many of the finer aspects of the game aren't talked about in game. You have to utilize the internet to know how it all works. Unskippable cutscenes and credits. Post game gameplay is severely lacking in content to continue pushing you towards the end goal of tempered elder fights. Main story is about as bland as a Hallmark Channel movie.There is more than this but the overall design is unnecessarily frustrating to play. Unlike Dark Souls or Bloodborne which have much more fluid fighting systems and is difficult but fair Monster Hunter World is decidedly the opposite.As for the port Constant multiplayer connection problems. Edit This has been fixed...finally. Joining friend s games should be easier. Chat is a joke. Limited to less characters than Twitter. Tabs are confusing. Very limited key binding options (You can't even bind Inventory to ""I"" or use Tab to view everyone in your game and mute them from there). In game mics are terrible. They are hidden in the sub menus and are either 100% on or 100% off. No toggling. Menus should all be transparent and allow you to move and look at the info. Again this is about game flow. Instead you have to stop what you're doing sit through an animation and move through a clunky menu system to get to anything. Nothing menu related is fast fluid or easy as it should be in this game. Mouse movement is really sluggish and inaccurate.Typical of Capcom these days their PC ports are sub standard. 1 year of waiting for a pc port for this? It's pretty half",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD
