Not to much like Hades but borrows some simple ideas (choosing a door for a relic, healing, item, etc.. Boon systems above average except that you need to earn extra 2 attacks.. If you're gunna steal features from Hades. At least start us off with a full kit (useless or not) skill tree (cuz rogue lite........). This is honestly what Ember Knights does well....

Its pacing is very off. The normal mobs move and attack extremely fast. Their attacks are very poorly telegraphed. There is no feedback when I get hit. So the game feels too fast. Yet, the bosses take 10 minutes to beat. They are such huge damage sponges that makes the gameplay feel boring at the boss stage. So odd! I would expected the bosses to go also ultra fast. In Hades, if I clear a mob room in 5-10 seconds, I can clear the boss room in 20, because the boss does not have 10,000x the hp of the mobs.\r\n\r\nYour \"hero\" is boring. There is no variability as the game progresses. Once you choose your weapon, there is only \"attack, dodge, spell\". While playing the game I don't feel any impact of the progression, almost all of which comes as passive additions to your stats (plus attack, plus chance to cast thunder, plus damage from burn, ...).\r\n\r\nOddly, even though I've beaten all major roguelike action top-down games at the highest difficulty (eg hades, curse of the dead gods, ravenswatch, Isaac, ...), I am having real trouble playing this game on easy mode, due to the insane speed of the standard mob, the poor telegrapjing, and the lack of response when I get hit, so I at least understand that I got hit and learn from the event.\r\n\r\nThe multiplayer aspect doesn't matter. It doesn't add any benefit to the game, as there is nothing in the game that is altered when you play solo or with 4 players. There is no cross player synergy, or interaction. You cannot exchange items, and you can't choose future items by consulting other players, as the item choice is hidden. What a poor design decision. At least let us consult each other on what items we should get????\r\n\r\nIn short, playing this game with friends is a positive aspect of me having friends, not a positive aspect of the game itself. \r\n\r\nI am very surprised this has 90% rating. Ravenwatch is vastly superior when it comes to progression, hero variability, and gameplay feeling, so I would recommend that one instead.", "timestamp_created": 1713617478, "timestamp_updated": 1713617478, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383275240659713745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163228068": {"recommendationid": "163228068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149571669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1500, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1714271769}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game and addicting!", "timestamp_created": 1713610294, "timestamp_updated": 1713610294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163162228": {"recommendationid": "163162228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198853501295", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2661, "playtime_at_review": 1365, "last_played": 1713609261}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u63a8\u85a6\u8ddf\u670b\u53cb\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u3000\u53cb\u8abc\u7684\u5c0f\u8239\u8aaa\u7ffb\u5c31\u7ffb", "timestamp_created": 1713529823, "timestamp_updated": 1713529867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534883737564086914", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163145984": {"recommendationid": "163145984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033889147", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 690, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1713896422}, "language": "english", "review": "worth", "timestamp_created": 1713502773, "timestamp_updated": 1713502773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163012206": {"recommendationid": "163012206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128468258", "num_games_owned": 1859, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1742, "last_played": 1707467287}, "language": "english", "review": "the fun parts about this game got butchered by balance patches...\n\nOld sword and hammer are dead, now you're left with slow, unfun weapons and awful relics that still exist in the pool untouched.

"review": "Once again I'm stuck wishing Steam had a better recommendation system than simply yes or no. Is this game enjoyable? Yes. Is it worth the full price of $19.99? Hard to say, bust most likely not for most people. While the game is enjoyable it suffers from a few major issues that cause the repeatability to be low. First off... multiplayer is dead. You could try Discord or Steam forums but finding people to play with isn't going to be the easiest challenge. This game is more designed for co-op play than solo play. As a solo player it will be more challenging and progress will be slower. The progression of the game feels very grindy. Why? Because there's no real deviation in the progression. You face the same mini-bosses and bosses in order. You have map 1, map 2, map 3, etc. For speedrunners doing the same thing over and over and over is just part of the course... but if you're not a speedrunner than this could make you lose interest in the game after a few runs. \n\nIf there was more progression unlocked each run it'd be fine. But even if you're able to consistently beat 2+ worlds each run it's just not much progression. There's only 6 weapons, which don't all feel that great, and your main progression goals are to unlock relic orbs, skill shards, and gain ember. Relic orbs unlock new relics (drops or room rewards) that give you active or passive abilities during your run. The skill shards are potential drops from mini-boss or bosses. These unlock new skills. You can, by default, have 2 skills you can gain during the run. The last progression are embers which let you unlock abilities. However these abilities are locked behind other requirements as well like having to invest X before unlocking or having to spend ember once in the tree to unlock alternate options. Basically it all boils down to meaning you're given an artificial grind to keep playing -- which is never a good look in a game.\n\nWith all that being said you'd think I'd have set my recommendation to a thumbs down. However... the game is fun. It just gets boring fast. But not all games need to be no-lifed. The download size is so small that I just pick this game up randomly from time to time and work on my progression. You take weeks or months for a break and the game feels fresh again... for a few more runs.\n\nSo while I think this game could drastically be improved with minor changes to the game... it's fun enough. I'd recommend getting it on a sale, it's not something you need to rush to buy, if you can. The game would be more fun if people actually played the multiplayer... but the game is dead. Not much you can do about it. I'm not surprised it's dead either.", "timestamp_created": 1710949701, "timestamp_updated": 1710949701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160982534": {"recommendationid": "160982534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126442397", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1712969682}, "language": "english", "review": "W GAME", "timestamp_created": 1710933056, "timestamp_updated": 1710933056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "160943929": {"recommendationid": "160943929", "author": {"steamid": "76561199219855469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4047, "last_played": 1711108943}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice game! also can be addictive.

Many of the old relics have undergone changes and aren't as enjoyable as they once were. I understand why these changes were made\u2014certain relics made it impossible to die, while others had broken scaling.\n\nFor instance, there used to be a relic that granted you a shield every time you perfected a skill. Now, if you perfect a skill, you have to wait 2 seconds. While this may seem like a minor nerf, those 2 seconds can significantly alter gameplay.\n\nAnother example is a legendary item that used to grant you attack power with every kill. Now, you have to get 4 kills to gain the same benefit.\n\nAgain, these changes aren't necessarily bad, but they do detract from the fun that was present during the beta phase. I remember breezing through the map in just 1 minute because I couldn't die\u2014I had over 1000 damage and a speed of over 600; it was insane. Now, I feel like some of that excitement has been diminished, making it harder to achieve. It's still possible, but definitely more challenging.\n\nAdditionally, some weapons have been reworked, and honestly, I'm not a fan. The hammer feels boring now, and even the staff has undergone changes. I haven't checked the rest, but I'm a little disappointed they altered some of these items.\n\nBecause of this I am rather stuck as to what I want to say.

The power ups in this game are incredibly weak and you are really limited with weapon choices as some do not fit the fast paced setting. This is more akin to a roguelike at times. \n\nFor $20 I think this is a solid roguelite and I've been enjoying it.

Adem\u00e1s hay un nodo de prestigio de cada arma.\n- \u00c1rbol de pasivas, las cuales se pueden mejorar a conveniencia.

A d\u00eda de hoy, se pueden elegir 2.\n- Sistema de da\u00f1o de elementos.\n- Sistema de reliquias que se adquieren durante la run. Pueden aportar beneficiod como puntos de armadura, adquirir efectos al esquivar, a\u00f1adir formas de curaci\u00f3n, mejora de da\u00f1o elemental...\n- 5 mundos, con un boss y un miniboss por mundo, salvo el \u00faltimo, cuya mec\u00e1nica de mundo tiene ciertas diferencias con los otros.\n- Sistema de dificultad ajustable tras completar la primera run.\n- Modo infinito, bien integrado con el sistema de dificultad.\n- Progresi\u00f3n variada e interesante.\n\nEn mi opini\u00f3n, bien vale los 20 euros. En mi caso, me sirve como un \"Hades\" (respecto a jugabilidad, la historia de EK es una excusa para disfrutar unas mec\u00e1nicas bien hechas, no un fin en s\u00ed misma) ya que tiene cierto aire, si

them is also something that never met, even after getting feedback regarding these balance issues, mainly the damage that enemies deal and last 2 zones (which they read and even answered), and it seems they would rather, atleast from the last patch, listen to the approximately 5 people that were saying that the game is too easy. \n\nThe game is good at it's core, but there are things that should take priority before making the game harder. Adding more difficulty modifiers when your game balance-wise isn't ready for it ain't it, and even at base game without modifiers it feels like you are playing with them. Also majority of them aren't even that interesting, it's mainly limitations and slaping more DMG, HP, Speed etc. on enemies and your options of countering these modifiers are either none or specific relics which are afew that will keep you somehow alive through all the bull**it the game throws at you. \n\nIf they fix these things, yeah, the game is worth it, even tho the biggest appeal of this game is the co-op option and it doesn't do a lot of things differently besides that.

I did love this and that whole game freeze  debacle still doesn't affect the 35+ hours I've spent, addicted  to this game and the rest of the hours  I'm  about to spend trying to beat the last boss  for that final item and then to continue on too the secret mode afterward.

I liked it enough to get all of the achievements and unlocks, and still play it just to see how far I can get with different setups. You could do worse for $20 bucks, but you could also do better - the game still needs some more time in the oven to patch out some things (endless mode tends to glitch from time to time as an example), and there are other rogue-likes that currently bring more to the table due to being out longer (Risk of Rain 2 being a good example, and games like Vampire Survivors being $5 bucks). If you like high-paced action and the flow of rogue-likes, you'll like this game.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Solid adventure mode\n- Tons of stuff to unlock via secrets\n- Challenging, will not hold your hand\n- Up to 4 player co-op, but fun as well solo\n- Easy to learn, and always fun finding new combos\n- No need to grind, any time you want to pick it up you can get right back to it\n- Replay-ability is good\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Game still needs some bugs ironed out. Endless Mode sometimes bugs out.\n- The lack of multiple worlds, and that the worlds follow the same path over and over, make the roguelike a bit too predictable.\n- With the amount of stuff enemies throw at you, along with having multiple players, can make it very easy to lose track of where you are which can cause getting hit or getting death a constant issue.\n- A lot of stuff seems to be a bit unbalanced. If you see crit-healing mentioned a lot, this is one of those unbalances. I also notice the \"First hit in room\" items/powers are underwhelming compared to their counterparts or other options.\n- The UI could use a redo, having it at the bottom covering parts of the screen, or fading making it hard to determine if my skills are charged, makes it very unhelpful.\n\nSuggestions for the game:\n\n- A randomizer challenge option would be a great addition. Shuffling the worlds, enemies, and bosses in an endless mode would be a fun way to shake things up. Even make relics and powers random!\n- Please reassign the UI somewhere else for the player's health/skills. The upper right hand corner for all players would be nice, and perhaps making it a bit smaller could also help. Can we please also have the players name's above their respective characters to help with keeping track of players, and maybe a small \"Super Smash Bros\" icon bubble for players of screen to help keep track of our team.\n- A rebalance of some relics and powers please - The \"First hit in room\" stuff needs some form of revamp or major buffs, and healing needs a look at too please - crit-glove should not be the only viable means of progression in Endless mode; perhaps reassign the crit glove as an Ember Tree option along with a couple other choices for healing, and maybe make an Ember Tree option for \"First hit in room\" to help buff those options (FHIR can apply twice, FHIR have a chance of reactivating, etc.) Soul Siphon could also use some love.\n- Bonus in-between areas after a boss fight would be cool, being able to fight a room full of both the previous world and upcoming worlds enemies for goodies would be cool, plus I would like to see how certain enemies from other world factions fight alongside each other.\n- Please give us a use for Ash after we have unlocked everything, we still have the rooms pop up even with Ash maxed out.\n\nOverall, I can see this game having a bright future, as the devs do respond in the Steam Discussions, and I can see both DLC and updates being something this game will have. Keep up the good work, Doom Turtle, I look forward to seeing where Ember Knights goes :)", "timestamp_created": 1705559522, "timestamp_updated": 1705559522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718535482883453369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156191180": {"recommendationid": "156191180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103352850", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1847, "last_played": 1712771087}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid Rogue-Like", "timestamp_created": 1705523986, "timestamp_updated": 1705523986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156151205": {"recommendationid": "156151205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408856869", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1230, "last_played": 1710545255}, "language": "english", "review": "game is goated on the sauce", "timestamp_created": 1705471088, "timestamp_updated": 1705471088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "156151173": {"recommendationid": "156151173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848057912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1123, "last_played": 1708133804}, "language": "english", "review": "Hades but Multiplayer.

This game was an absolute blast to play through. The art is beautiful, the character design felt really nice, and the music is top notch. If you're new to rouge-lites the gameplay might be tough at first because this game is actually really challenging, but with enough patience you can quickly learn each enemies' attack patterns. Each world is unique and has a good variety of different enemy types. The world bosses are tough at first, but the real challenge begins when you unlock their variants. Each boss's variant is an extra type of pain, but nothing gets tougher than Blizzard Brauma. As a few others have said in their reviews, he's the true final boss. If you're unlucky enough to encounter him, your run will either end abruptly or be in a critical position after beating him. When it comes to the Skills and Relics the game has to offer, there's something for everyone. \n\nOn the topic of Relics, that's where my biggest issue with the game comes in. Sure, there's a ton of Relics and the builds you can create are vast, but one of the [i]only[/i] viable builds you can use to complete a run most of the time is Crit-Heal. It's unbelievably busted and you really need a way to heal almost constantly because of how much damage enemies do late game. Aside from that, the only other irritation I had with the game was the way of obtaining more colors for the Embers. There are a few that you can unlock by completing runs in specific ways, whether that be your first run, a run on endless mode, or by completing a run with the difficulty modifiers all the way up. However, to get [i]every[/i] color will require a large amount of luck and patience. Every world has a secret room that can only be opened by using a specific skill. Not only do you need to get lucky and obtain the skill needed [i]before[/i] that room appears, but you [i]also[/i] have to hope and pray the room even spawns. It was a huge pain in the ass to accomplish this, but I eventually succeeded (around 40 runs) and got that achievement. This might be a lot easier to do in multiplayer, but I didn't have that luxury because the online seems to be dead at the time of writing this review. I did get to play one run of multiplayer with my buddies, and lemme tell ya, it was such a chaotically fun time.\n\nOverall, this game gets a 9/10 from me and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys rouge-lites and/or just likes playing games with friends.

The game is way too much fun to play in general by yourself and with all the weapons you have to choose from it really makes you want to sink a few hours into it. That isn't even bringing up the fact that later on you get to upgrade all the weapons to make them that much better and opens up alot of new styles and ways to play with your favorites or maybe even reconsider a weapon you thought maybe wasn't all that great. There is some Dead Cells inspiration in this for sure and the fast combat paired with the very colorful background while all these enemies are trying to kill you and move around while your doing the same is all super exciting. There are a bunch of different relics to unlock and builds to truly make your own to make each one vastly more or less effective than before. If you have friends this game honestly doubles in fun and replayability infinitely so. Me and my buddies discussing what works and what doesn't while we all try the same weapon or all completely different was an absolute blast. Without saying too  much about the game honestly just do yourself a favor and buy it. Theres a roadmap up of still more content coming and I couldn't be happier. Dev if your reading this would love to talk to you about your game and maybe even a few suggestions and would like to add for a first game you guys knocked it out of the park. Im a hell of a critic these days and I love your game.\n\n02/06/24 After the new update I cannot complete a single item build now even in 2 full runs for some reason as it feels like the items I want/need are removed from drops and stores altogether and it attempts to force you to use the same 5 or 6 items every single run weather you want them or not. Certain items were changed for the better and others have been made useless and in turn making certain builds no longer fun to play. Seems like instead of balancing certain bosses some of them just had there damage boosted higher and there attack speed increased without considering what the original problem was. Poltergeist and new ending Praxis boss fight are no longer fun to play. Poltergeist gets to leave the arena a whole 3rd time now at the end making you fight even more adds before getting his damn fight over with. New Praxis end fight is him not even in the arena fighting you for over 60% of the fight but instead it is him teleported away while you dodge the same damn lasers over and over and over again. This is not difficulty this is artificially lengthening a boss fight for....0 good reason. This whole thing needs to be re thought out and re done. New cursed items were a fun idea but there downsides until you break the curse far outweigh me even grabbing them anymore. New weapon is good but there seems to be confliction as to what the devs think some of the weapons issues are and what is actually happening. One example being the mantle weapon can insta kill dudes anywhere in the arena even if there not within range of the charge even though the Dev says they only get killed in the circle.

Skill definitely plays a role, the more you can dodge the better off you will be. But in the later stages the enemies deal 50+ damage on a single hit so if you don't have substantial healing you can easily die in 3-4 hits from full health.\n\nSo sure, we can all agree that healing is good, but the items you can get from healing early game are very limited. You have an item where you heal when you enter a room (1/room, pretty lame on its own), critical hits heal, and food you find lying around. If you don't get at least 1 healing item, your run is going to be hard. I think I've only beaten a run without a healing item once so far, and that's because I did an armored build.\n\nWays I suspect it could be fixed would be to reward you for going for an armored build where all armor related items help you stack armor higher (right now, if you have two armor giving items such as the relic that gives 1 armor when you kill an enemy and another relic that gives 5 armor if  you achieve a perfect skill use, you can have a max of 15 armor because both items only give that as a max) I'd rather it be something where if you have 4 different level 1 relics that give armor or rely on armor for boost, you get a max of 30 armor, 15 for the first relic, and +5 for each subsequent armor related relic. \n\nStill, even if my personal gripe doesn't get fixed, the game is a great purchase and a lot of fun with friends.

Steam deck experience is great.\n\nWe were able to get the final ending on Hard within a couple of days, which was a little disappointing. Like another reviewer said, some classes and items are questionable and sustain seems to be necessary after a certain point. \n\nHaving win conditions is fine, and having certain builds be better than others is also fine. These are things that are endemic to roguelites in general. However, the issue with Ember Knights is that the win conditions and better builds seem to be painfully limited to a select few variants. This damps down on the game\u2019s replayability. Once you\u2019ve had \u201cthe run\u201d, there\u2019s not much point in trying to replicate that experience with other builds and/or characters.\n\nNow, it\u2019s a new game and I haven\u2019t put in a ton of time experimenting.

It has some concepts which make it interesting.\n\nFor example, you only get one (iniitially) life to play through the whole content. Coupled with sparse healing possibilities in the 4 worlds you play, this gives a challenge. \n\nAs you play you gain more hp, damage and other stats, and unlock skills and relics, which you can then get randomly from specific rooms in the worlds during your next playthroughs. All stats, skills and relics disappear upon death/quit, so each next playthrough you supposedly start from 0, except blue coins (earned during play) which you keep.\n\nThe blue coins can be used to permanently improve your initial setup /specifics at Ember tree in the start of the game (such as unlocking abilities to revive up to 3 times in a playthrough, etc).\n\nWhen you finish the game on initial difficulty, the ante is raised, with unlocking new (choosable) difficulty levels. You then can grind for weapon upgrades, and use them together with skills and relics to get great combos helping make playthroughs a satisfying breeze.\n\nSo far very good. If you finish the content in the one run, you get option to continue next run keeping all your stats, skills and relics. \n\nAll in all, a decent way to squeeze a lot of replaybility out of really not very much content.\n\nUnfortunately the focus on adding new relics and skills, instead of new maps, is the biggest drawback for the game. \n\nBy now there are so many relics and skills to choose from, that your chance on getting a good combo is tiny. And *without* getting a good combo, you can easily die completely in the first world even if you've maxed all your weapon and Ember tree options (which are the only permanent improvements). Point in fact, I wanted to grab some points for relic buying, and toned the difficulty to simple +50%, ... and died completely (ie used up my 3 half lives) on the boss of the 4d world.\n\nNowadays, I frequently run the game through first 3 (easier) worlds just to see if I manage to get a good combo of relics and skills to go on. If not, I will simply try to earn enough blue coins to recoup my expenses (you can unlock option to purchase some random relics for them at start of game as well), and quit.\n\nSo, the annoying thing is that even if you've finished all content and maxed everything, you are still at mercy of randomness for your chance to have a satisfying \"I've maxed it, now I can just cut through things like a knife\" feeling. Even at minimum difficulty.\n\nThe feeling is very frustrating for me and for that reason, I still mark the game as one I do not recommend, even though I have played it quite enough.

It looks nice, it feels good at first, but the more you play the more frustrating it gets:\n1. Upgrading health doesn't really help with survival because enemies always hit you hard and destroy the same part of your health all the time. In the beginning you start with 80 hp, they hit you for 8. Late game you have 200 hp, they hit you for 32. Thus the only thing that really helps with survival is crazy dodging all the time. But here goes the issue number 2\n2. The more abilities you collect, the more hellish your screen gets. In late game you cannot see what's going on on the screen because of all the lightnings and lasers and other crazy stuff. It makes dodging very hard. How could you dodge something you couldn't even see? I have 150+ hours in Hades and I had never have any issue of the sort\n3. Disconnects in coop can and will ruin your run. You get good gear with your friend, you make the best run so far and then you get disconnected and there's no way to connect back. The button for reconnection disappears after the first click and never comes back\n\nThe only way to truly enjoy this game is to get lucky and collect gear for healing early enough so you upgrade it before the run gets too difficult. It would allow you to finally stop crazy dodging all the time and safely take some hits.

We play on easy mode since my friend has never done a game like this before, and even after 10 hours of gameplay, we are still having a tough time playing. We still get far as I'm more experienced, but it's no fun if one of us is constantly dead for long periods of time. Here is a non exhaustive list of things we have noticed that are causing us issues;\n\nOverpowered enemies - \nEnemies (and bosses, for that matter) feel way overpowered. It's not as noticeable in the earlier worlds, but I find from world 3 onward, if you don't have a good armor or heal build, you're dead with just a couple ill-timed hits. The divide between enemy damage and relic healing is so absurd, you better get real good at perfecting rooms. This seems to be the main issue brought up by other negative reviewers.\n\nEnemies do not flinch -\nSince enemies hit really hard compared with how much health you have, the fact that they can cruise right through your attacks until you finally kill them is incredibly frustrating, especially with slow, close-combat weapons like the hammer. Good luck if you want to try playing the tank, there's basically no point.\n\nDodging/rolling feels delayed - \nBoth my friend and I agree that dodging feels delayed in that we still get hit despite having visually (on-screen) dodged the attack. It's hard to explain properly but it's still something I've noticed while in the middle of playing. It is also a very short distanced dodge so good luck with the bigger boss enemies or enemies with wider-spread attacks.\n\nBullet hell - \nIf you are planning on playing with friends, be aware that later worlds quickly become a mess with enemies and constant attacks flying across your screen. Lingering attacks hoard available play space and your character can easily get caught in corners or on crevice edges in the middle of the arena. Essentially, our poor movement speed and short dodge distance often can't handle the barrage of enemies and attacks. Attacks also seem to overlap in that there are times where it is virtually impossible to evade without getting hit since there is nowhere to go that won't GET YOU HIT. This is felt especially with worlds 5 and 6 where I alone (my friend had no chance of surviving) only survived as long as I did because I made some stupid build with armor + perfect skill healing build (+ the dice skill which healed me on good rolls). I WAS ONLY ALIVE BECAUSE I WAS BASICALLY INVINCIBLE. The fact that successful runs are so restricted to having one of few good builds really takes the fun out of the game.\n\nAll in all, this is not to say that you won't have fun playing.

The bow took me 2 runs and now I just can't get enough of it. \n It's just, the scaling of the worlds feels off. While you steamrole through the first world with any build or weapon, the second world will fuck you up, if you took a mellee weapon without enough dmg. The bow and the shuriken(Forgot the actual name) are stupidly overpowered and make every other weapon obsolete. The hammer feels, clunky, slow, not worth your time. A slowly charging weapon in a fast paced game. Feels like the defs did not want you to use this weapon at all. \nThere are a few minor things here and there, enemie spawns that instantly hit you to ruin your perfect room, repetetive bosses (and no, a new colorscheme is not a new monster) that are kinda boring and the weird scaling...\n\nWhat makes push the \"Do not buy\" button is the fact, that this game randomly crashes after bosses. I can't find a fix for it, the common tricks won't do and I seem not to be the only one to have this issue. \n\nAn unpolished gem with a major crack in it...

Not a lot of it positive in my eyes.\n\n1) Many of the fun ways to play the weapons has been altered or made much harder to achieve. The hammer dodge jump? Removed for being too much fun. Now the hammer is incredibly clunky and confusing as to why it even exists. Ah, yes, I would like to play the SLOW MOVING, CHARGING WEAPON CLASS in a game where life or death comes down to less than a tenth of a second. Do you play your own game or is there a joke I'm missing somewhere? How many armor items do you need to acquire to make completely immobile, attacking-once-every-two-second gameplay viable? Likewise, the blender sword build has been removed and replace with a single spin slash. But now it has fire. Exciting to the three players left who actually use the fire status, I'm sure.\n\n2) The majority of the relics are bafflingly bad.\"Hmm, would I rather heal every single time I cast a spell for 2, or heal for 1 every time I finish a room? Gee, game, this is a hard choice. Why not invalidate both options and just gain 5 armor on every spell cast? Which is health, but better?\" Sure, healing items have synergies that can work together to make an undying monster, but I want ANYONE to find a justification for an item that heals a SINGLE health point upon ENTERING a new room. Go ahead. An entire relic slot that takes 5 rooms to be as useful as an apple. It's funny, to say the least.\n\n3) The final world is horribly designed. I have no other way to describe it. The boss mechanic being horribly telegraphed lasers that do 20 damage less than 0.2 seconds after a telegraph, in a room full on enemies that can and will do 45+ damage per hit, and then having that laser be spammed 10 times just to make sure it hits the player at least once? Yeah. Good job. The massive orbs aren't much better, doing 27 damage and taking up an unreasonable amount of the screen space. If it was the ONLY thing I had to worry about? Sure. No problem. BUT AGAIN, the 6th's world's scaling makes it impossible to avoid everything.\n\n4) Healing is now required, and is no longer a suggestion. I used to run through the whole game without any healing relics, as a fun challenge for myself. Now? Good luck. Bosses have been given extra attacks that fill the screen with clutter so that at least SOMETHING will hit you, enemies are more aggressive, and safer playstyles have been nerfed or limited. Every single build I make now has to have, at minimum, a way to heal 30 health on demand, because that is how much the most basic enemy does in worlds 5 and 6. Before ANY modifiers to make that worse. That means every single build has to be a crit build or an armor build unless you play flawlessly. So every build needs at least 2 crit heal gloves, 2 juicy opals... and while we're at it, we might as well weaponize the healing, so... let's grab a scythe. Now that we have sustain AND healing, we might as well get some armor, to weaken any hits we take while healing. So armor boots or perfect cast armor wand. 2 of each would be ideal. Damn, no more room for damage artifacts? Oh well. At least I can survive a few hits from the enemies now. Didn't get any damage or crit crystals, though? Just end the run. It's done. After all, surviving the enemies doesn't matter if you can't kill them. For those that don't believe me? Try a run with the bow and spreadshot. Get crit heal gloves. Get a juicy opal. Get heal berries. And watch as you heal over 30 health every second. Congratulations, you have unlocked video game reviewer mode and the only build that can facetank any amount of damage in world 6.\n\n5) New boss changes are not enjoyable. Early bosses have been given massive increases to either their HP, damage, or new mechanics that can and will clip you. Boss variants are just straight up unreasonable to deal with and seem to have lost the understanding of what made the miniboss variants fun. The boss variants don't add a new gameplay twist, they simply remove the weaknesses they had and give them a huge set of new attacks that are both unenjoyable to deal with and epitomize the problem with modern gaming: Why make a fun encounter when I can just make my boss invulnerable and swarm them with summons that do nothing to the boss's health bar? Everyone loves when the boss just inexplicably becomes invulnerable and chooses when you can hit them. We used it a little before, but NOW we can put it on ALL OF THEM. However, nothing epitomizes this problem like world 2's boss variant: Between each phase shift, he teleports to his throne. On normal, this lasts about 10 seconds. You can rush him and take advantage of blind spots to give yourself free damage time when it ends and he emotes. On altered? He stays invulnerable for as long as it takes you to defeat 20 summons. That's right, a reasonable TWENTY enemies. While being attacked every single second by the boss. It is so bad it makes me angry.\n\nIf Brugal is the poster child, Poltergeist might be the worst boss I have ever played in any video game. I beat it first try with my wife, and neither of us lost a life, but we were both so annoyed by it that we put our controllers down and went off to do something else. The entire fight is nothing but a series of rotating summons that do almost nothing to you. You just have your time on this earth taxed into nothingness. Did you not kill the summons FAST ENOUGH? Good news! The boss can immediately re-enter the invulnerability and summon the EXACT SAME SUMMONS as soon as it ends. It is a literal run killer if you got unlucky with damage pick ups. (Who designs garbage like this and is proud of it?)\n\nIf by some miracle the game developer reads this? Here's your TL;DR : Stop adding invulnerability phases to your boss fights. If you're going to have summons, they need to share a health pool with the boss. NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING, is more frustrating than being given a meaningless chore in the middle of an otherwise entertaining encounter. Bosses deciding it isn't your turn to hit them has never been engaging in any video game. It never will be. You remove any and all nuance to a fight by doing this. I can't choose to risk taking more damage and attacking when I know I shouldn't. I can't choose to do anything other than wait or do the homework given to me by the boss.", "timestamp_created": 1703921531, "timestamp_updated": 1703921531, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 113, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715704858303070068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "154778202": {"recommendationid": "154778202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019111897", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1704613712}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of fun!

Previously, I enjoyed casual runs, managing well with half the difficulty bar. Now, however, even at the base difficulty and without additional mods, we're forced to adopt high-effort strategies and select the best weapon mods to stand a chance. The update has overpowered every mob, adding numerous extra attacks. In multiplayer, this transforms the game into an almost bullet-hell scenario, making it exceedingly tough to avoid getting hit. The challenge escalates as mobs target multiple players, leading to situations where dodging one attack results in colliding with another aimed at a teammate.

I would've made this a post or maybe even brought it up in the Discord, but I'm not interested in having my voice drowned out by apologists.\n\nI was looking forward to weapons becoming more flexible and viable with a variety of builds, but instead you doubled down and are (in a way) forcing us to play using charge attacks for almost all weapons.  Charge attacks (no matter how good they are) do not lend themselves to the fast paced nature of this game where if you blink - you die.  My friends that I play with were so disappointed with the changes that they lost all interest in playing at all and simply turned off the game before starting a run.  I did however do a solo run with the sword to test the changes and the game just felt more difficult somehow, I felt like like I was completely at the mercy of RNG, there was even a room where it turned into bullet hell and I did not have a single moment to breathe.  I don't understand why the designer(s) of this game want to make the game punishingly unfair, but congratulations, it feels brutal and not in a fun way.  The weapon mods in the previous patch were not perfect, but there was some good choices, now the only choices that were viable previously have been completely removed and/or changed for the worse, in favor of providing a more \"challenging\" experience.  I don't know who is asking to make the game more difficult, but it's definitely not my friends and I.  It feels like the only weapon that received a straight upgrade was the Bow.  The scythe, hammer, sword, staff and chakram were just down right nerfed in their utility and build viability in favor of charge attacks.\n\nI'm no stranger to challenges and difficulty, I mean I got all the achievements and got the true ending, I beat it with all weapons and I persevered in the face of absolute bulls*it the game dishes out at you.  That still doesn't mean that it is an easy game by any stretch of the imagination, and I'm not particularly asking for the game to become a walk in the park.  But seriously, and I say this with a lot of respect for the game you made: please stop being afraid to give more power to the player, let us feel comfortable with our choices.  Let me have fun.\n\nTo the developers: If you read all of this and are still confused about what I'm talking about, I'd be willing to discuss it further.  But I'm not sure how much help that would be if your vision for the game is already set in stone.

With friends it's a great time for 15-20 hours, and you'll definitely get your money's worth. I played pre- and post-release and not much changed between, it's missing some polish for what would make it feel like a finished product.\n\nIn short: It feels like the devs started out with a great foundation and potential, then lost interest partway through and just pushed to get the game out. Just about every single thing about Ember Knights shows good promise, then falls flat.\n\nGameplay: \n-- Core gameplay is fun enough, but as other people have mentioned, the runs all end up feeling the same despite it being a roguelite. There's not enough diversity of powers, synergies, enemies or zones, and it's a set linear path with a set pattern for rooms, bosses, etc., which makes the endless mode extra unappealing, and the game relies on you wanting to play the endless mode.\n-- Challenge is middling for a roguelite, with difficulty spikes lategame. Replayability is very low in its current state.\n-- Later stages are so visually overstimulating it detracts from the experience, with large enemies rolling up the sides of the screen that you can't kill but shoot large projectiles as additional obstacles. I have no issue with that, except the enemies overlap and hide regular enemies shooting or jumping at you from underneath. Those are high-damage stages where every hit really counts, so big yikes.\n\nLore/aesthetics: \n-- The world *looks* like it has cool lore, but only a bare minimum is provided, and so progress through the game visually feels disjointed and the art direction often feels random even if it is nice. \n-- Stage design is meh.\n-- There is little story background given for anything going on and about most of the characters and neither does anyone have any personality.\n\nMultiplayer: Bear in mind I played exclusively 4-player.\n-- The player character models are similar enough for it to be extremely easy to lose track of who or where you are, especially with a lot of enemies on screen.\n-- I have a huge problem with the player info (HP, skills available, armor, icon, etc.) where at least in 4-player, it covers not only a portion of the bottom of the screen, but a portion that overlays gameplay. It goes mostly transparent when any player is behind it, which means you 1) can't reliably see enemies shooting you when it's not transparent, and 2) when it IS transparent, you can barely see what your stats are or if your skills are ready. The fade-in, fade-out of the player info as people pass under it just adds to the overall visual overstimulation and frustrating messiness of 4-player multiplayer.\n\nEdit post-Reforge update: Literally nothing to change to anything of the above. Game is still unbalanced, buggy and unsatisfying.

I like game-play aspects but this game fails in some crucial areas. Specifically, the replay value falls off quickly. The game takes about 25 minutes to play through start to finish once you've gotten good at it. There are 5 maps with differing rooms, at first they seem detailed but you quickly realize there is little variety in each map. I have seen the same identical rooms populate with the same enemies three times in a row and this sort of thing is pretty common. There is poor balance between the various skills and relics, where some are must haves and others garbage. Each play-through you try to build an optimum strategy with the relics you happen to find, problem is, you only get to pick from a small pool each time and as you unlock more relics on each play through, most of them being less than useful, it actually makes it harder to make a meaningful and cohesive build. The more you unlock the more randomness fights your ability to make useful builds. There are some things that mitigate this, like rerolls, but they are very limited in use. Its a little disappointing because the game has great potential, but my primary issue is the monotonous replay through a very short game with little variety. Enemy variety is poor as well, there about 3 or 4 models per map that come in different colors to represent tougher versions.  For the price of this game I'd expect more, especially comparing it to other games in this genre, this one falls short. Would be fun to play with friends if you can get it on sale, just don't expect it to hold your interest for long.\n\n4/12 Update:\nDecided I'd update my review and change it to recommend. I enjoy this game, its not perfect but it is pretty fun especially with friends. They've added some QoL improvements and some other good updates, however the game still falls short in many areas as mentioned in my earlier review, such as the lack of variety in enemies or stages and poor balance with some skills and such. All said, its a decent party game.

De verdad, lo que esta gente ha parido, a nivel cooperativo, del reto que plantea a los jugadores y el mimo que destila por cada pixel, lo convierte en un referente dentro de este g\u00e9nero, como en su dia fue DEAD CELLS en los metroid-vania.\n\nSobre la historia que sirve de excusa hay poco que comentar, un malo quiere acabar con el \u201cfuego\u201d de la vida, y nosotros deberemos vencerlo, gracias a conseguir ascuas en cada una de las incursiones. Los personajes que nos ayudar\u00e1n en nuestra aventura tienen un dise\u00f1o especial, todo lo contrario que el malo final, el cual se ve algo gen\u00e9rico. De todos modos, aqu\u00ed lo importante es la jugabilidad, y de esta hay toneladas.\n\nAunque por momento, la cantidad de da\u00f1o que recibimos de los enemigos, es algo elevada, y castiga muchos los errores, la cantidad de habilidades y mec\u00e1nicas a nuestra disposici\u00f3n igualan bastante el combate. Adem\u00e1s, seg\u00fan vas desbloqueando \u201chabilidades\u201d se amplia much\u00edsimo la variedad de builds, con distintos poderes /estados y beneficios con los que podemos enfrentarnos a los enemigos. Estos, aunque tienen bastante variedad, pecan de lo mismo que el juego, les falta algo de \u201caleatoriedad, me explico; si el juego tuviera mas armas, poderes y enemigos que pudieran entre-mezclarse, no seria tan lineal como acaba resultando. No es un problema enorme, pero te queda el mal sabor de boca con la poca profundidad que tiene en este aspecto.\n\nDe una u otra manera, al igual que hace a\u00f1os recomendaba a boca llena el DEAD CELLS,  hoy puedo trasladar esos comentarios a esta obra. De lo mas divertido actualmente en el catalogo de steam, valido para todo la familia, y de esos juegos que te hacen latir el corazoncito mas fuerte.\n[b]\n\ud83d\udcbb Necesita de un pelin de potencia\n\n\ud83c\udfae Para mando, no mames.\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83e\udd1d\u200d\ud83e\uddd1 Cooperativo Local\n\ud83d\udce1 Perfecto para el Remote Play\n\ud83d\udd35 Una pasada en la Deck \n\ud83d\udd2760FPS | 5 WAT | 1200GPU \n\n\ud83d\udc6a Se puede jugar con toda la familia\n[/b]\n[i]\nS\u00edguenos [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/2535301/]aqu\u00ed[/url] y ay\u00fadanos con nuestro mentor \ud83e\udd1f\nValora para que llegue a m\u00e1s gente, gracias! \ud83d\udc4d\n[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1698334315, "timestamp_updated": 1698334342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148895409": {"recommendationid": "148895409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121266406", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3431, "last_played": 1698305672}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8054\u673a=\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u65e0\u9650\u8fde\u4e0d\u8fdb\u623f\u95f4", "timestamp_created": 1698305877, "timestamp_updated": 1698305877, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148881648": {"recommendationid": "148881648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052373301", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1707210597}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, even better with friends! :3", "timestamp_created": 1698280447, "timestamp_updated": 1698280447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148880255": {"recommendationid": "148880255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835281640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5587, "last_played": 1709499636}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game but sucks that there is no save function.  \nWTF.

Progress you character permanently by getting ash/embers from killing bosses and temporarily by getting stat orbs during your run.\n\nGame currently has 6 worlds to beat (you start off with 5, unlock 6th later) and harder difficulties with modifiers that you unlock later on after beating world 5. Game has endless mode as well for those that want it.\n\nCurrently, however the game has no way to save you runs. So if your tight for time then chances are you might want to avoid this game for now (the devs are thinking about adding a save feature but have have to reach a final decide on the topic). Currently though, the game can be beaten in an hour or so (or less if your skilled/got the proper set up, my first world 5 win i did in 44 mins roughly) so its not too big of a deal if you got at least 2h of free time id say.\n\nThe game is also very fast paced and rewards quickness. Shortly after beating the first few worlds you will unlock \"aid packages\" that you can get after killing bosses if you manage to get to it before a set time. First world you need to beat in under 7 mins to get the aid package and so on. It may sound tuff, but it is doable.\n\nAll keys are rebindable, options to disable screen shake, turn on full screen, ect.

I wouldn't say it's the most memorable game that'll stick with you for ages, but it's definitely very engaging for your time with it.\n\nThe artistic quality is strong. The designs of the knights all have a lot of visual clarity and the animations match the smooth gameplay. Music is pretty great and fits the action. The ability to choose and unlock your knight's aesthetics is greatly appreciated (who doesn't love a bit of customization?)\n\nThe gameplay feels smooth paced, you feel very mobile, and naturally as you progress you start to feel more powerful. The difficulty feels challenging but fair, you're not dealing with any stupid one-shots unless you've chosen to ramp up the damage (endgame feature) and go into endless mode.\n\nThe story is weak, but is weak enough it's pretty clear it's really just a device to carry you through the setting, so it doesn't really leave you feeling disappointed.\n\nThe only real critique I have is that the different weapons don't feel equally viable. The game definitely favors ranged combat and kiting, making the bow, staff, and to a lesser extent the star feel infinitely superior. While damage doesn't feel unfair, it is rather significant and healing is very limited. Putting yourself in melee range involves being point blank with the melee attacks that most enemies use to hurt you.\n\nThe artifacts can offer you more persistent healing, but they rather quickly reach a cap. This means you can get enough healing for sustaining yourself through a single run, but your healing will quickly fall off in comparison to enemy damage as you pursue endless mode.\n\nArtifacts and power up gems affect all weapons equally, meaning your bow will be doing just as much damage, applying the same status effects, and attacking just as fast as your sword. It feels like there's virtually no incentive to use the melee weapons for this reason.\n\nDespite the issues with the balance between the weapons, the artifacts do feel very balanced, with most builds feeling equally viable. Healing feels like a must, but other than that, a stun build, a burn build, a poison build, etc, all feel pretty on par with each other and can successfully carry you through a run.\n\nWould recommend for if you're looking for a roguelike you can sink into for a bit and play with your buds.", "timestamp_created": 1696715377, "timestamp_updated": 1696715377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147818202": {"recommendationid": "147818202", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995016267", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 68, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1713381960}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome online coop experience.

It should be more health, more damage, and more abilities. For Instance, there should be more clear stages instead of throwing mini-bosses since it's too easy and just like taking a rest. It should be more AOE,  high frequent melee attacks, maybe mirror clones, lasers, teleport,etc. If you guys want to add mini bosses, maybe just put it in previous levels but a lot stronger than now.\n(2)IThis game can be longer and having more bosses instead of minions. And the bosses can have more abilities and interactions with the knights, final bosses, reward systems.

We played Lost Castle A LOT and it was very fun. Since we usually play once a weekend, most of us are drunk and half of us are non gamers, we played Lost Castle for like a year or so.\n\nI was hoping ember knights to be our long waited replacement for Lost Castle, and it seems worthy since the game play is indeed fun and fast paced. However, here are some suggestions I'd like to see in order to have a smothier \"party\" play style:\n\n1. Add a softer revival mechanic: even though the game is fast paced, the down time is huge when people die. On my runs with friends they were dead 3/4 of the world while I was just single playing the game. Things get even worse since dead people wont get any upgrades, thus making it harder when they revive. Also dead people just get bored, which is worse since the game is so exciting. The suggestion here is just let people revive using mechanics like pressing buttons on other dead embers or so. If you are worried about making the game easier, just add a dificult setting or something.\n\n2. Playing the game in group makes the game harder on bosses: It seems that some mechanics on bosses are meant for single player not multiplayer, I mean, when the first boss spawns the lightning bolts, I'm very able to dodge them when alone but things get totally out of controll if there is someone else. The bolts will drop on both of us making the dodge space smaller, I never got to try it when there where more than 2 people alive, but I bet it would be impossible to doge or very hard at least. Here I suggest that the monster IA just target one of the players at random so the patterns are more predictable. Making changes to the ressurect mechanic would make this easier to handle as well.\n\n3. Allow more ember color customizations or even \"gender\" choice.

I already have 20+ hours on it in less than a week, and I'd rate it an 8.5/10.\n\n[h3] Content: [/h3]\nThere are 6 different weapons, all of which are equally unique in their playstyles. You can select up to 3 (out of 9) weapon modifications unique to that weapon, which adds even more variation to the weapons you can use. There are 80+ relics to choose from with synergies and themes, so the builds can vary heavily. There are around 20 skills in the game that you must find in your runs, and you can equip up to 2 of them. There are 5 stats, which include HP, attack damage, skill damage, crit rate, and speed. The Ember Tree is like a rune system where you can select perks for your runs (heal after clearing a room, bonus damage against bosses, etc.). There are a total of 5 worlds with unique enemies and bosses. You can choose to modify the difficulty of the game with 3 difficulties (easy, normal, and hard) and modifiers (bonus enemy HP, bonus enemy spawn, etc.).\n\n[h3] Gameplay: [/h3]\nOverall, the gameplay is smooth, and the movement feels fluid. Players can roll, which allows you to cross gaps in terrain and grants i-frames. When using attacks or skills, there is a mechanic called \"perfect\" casting that grants bonuses to your attacks or skills. Perfects require good timing, and some relics are tied to the perfect mechanic. During runs, players can choose between different rooms such as stat rooms, skill rooms, shops, bonus gold, or bonus ember, which allows for more freedom of choice.\n\n[h3] Multiplayer: [/h3]\nThe netcode is insanely good. I have played online with poor internet and still had seamless gameplay as a server and client. Loot is multiplied by the number of players, so there is no need to fight over loot. Players can use the same weapon as each other as well. Player and outfit colors can be changed to personalize your character and distinguish yourself in multiplayer lobbies; these are purely cosmetic. The difficulty is amplified based on the number of players there are, and you can further increase the game's difficulty by modifying the run prior to starting. The progress gained from multiplayer is only saved for the host.\n\n[h3] Needed Improvements: [/h3]\nThough this game is good, it is far from perfect. There are only 5 worlds (including the final boss world) in each run, and they are always encountered in the same exact order. It would be nice if they added more variety or mixed up the maps. I think having at least 3 varieties for each non-final boss world would fix the much-needed depth this game lacks. Rogue-likes rely heavily on their replayability, and the lack of world diversity really hurts that aspect of this game. This is the reason for the -1.5 points in my rating.

It's very clear that the developers were heavily influenced by Hades, but there is enough different here to make it very very much worth playing.  Besides the different weapons and the various upgrades that they can have equipped, in each run, you can hold up to two skills at a time.  Skills are abilities that you can trigger at any time at the press of a button, and will have offensive and/or defensive abilities.  These are on a cool-down, but the way the cool-down works is interesting; instead of waiting a certain amount of time, it's a certain number of hits with your weapon you must make in order to refill the cool-down.  It rewards aggression and quick reflexes, it's a lot of fun.\n\nThe story is extremely simple, to the point where it almost doesn't exist, so don't expect Hades-level dialogue, but I do think that, when the combat really clicks, it is about as good as the combat of Hades.  My one caveat about the game play is that it is kind of easy.  I don't think it's TOO easy, especially considering that you have to do a run with a lot of points in this game's version of pact of punishment, but it is definitely on the easy side.\n\nAnother way in which I wish this took more from Hades is the quantity of content.  Not that they have to have the same amount of content that Hades did, that's a ridiculous standard to hold anybody to.  However, once you complete the game, there's pretty much nothing left to do.  I've 100% the game with the exception of a handful of achievements, and I only have 24.5 hours total in the game.

This bullet hell change, large arenas where bosses run off screen, it doesn't work well with local co-op. It actually makes it better that one of your teammates dies, so it's not requiring you to fight over the camera. Act 1 is the sweat spot, but I don't think that design noticed that, since the arena's got bigger, while the camera stays zoomed in.(If the camera zoomed WAAAAY out to compensate for bosses running across the map, that would really help with this specific problem) \n\nThe item pool is small... a game like this, for repeat runs, you need a large pool of items, where each run will feel unique. Also, the items that \"are\" there aren't all equal. Most items are inferior to just building a \"cooldown-focused, summons, and all damage does poison damage\" build.

What I mean by this is that after playing for 5 hours I had already been getting messages from the game saying I had gotten every single item for a specific rarity, after only really doing about 13 runs. If you're aware of how roguelikes go, even if you're pretty good at them, 13 runs is not a lot of runs whatsoever. \n\nOn the more positive side, it is co-op and does make the experience feel really catered towards playing with friends when you actually ARE playing with friends. Enemy variety definitely exists, and I don't think I was ever in a position in which I was incapable of doing anything about my situation.\n\nWeapon Variety and Combat\n\nWeapon variety exists in a really broad manner in the form of 5 completely unique weapons with their own completely unique mechanics, with all but one feeling entirely viable and enjoyable to play with and build stats around. \nThe two weapons though that really stuck out to me in terms of what the combat does really well and also does really poorly would be the staff and the hammer respectively. \nThe staff allows you to build fully into your magic abilities and allows you to charge these attacks up incredibly quickly to actually push into the gameplay of a fully fledged mage, probably the most fun I've had is in this incredibly well thought out mechanic to create this kind of gameplay with the way combat works in this game. \nOn the other hand, the heavy hammer, while i understand the point of it's design, is too sluggish in a game where you have to constantly be aggressive while weaving through enemy attacks and for the most part, trying to take as little damage as possible. The reason I comment on that specifically is because of the hammer's unique ability to have a 3 level charged combo, which realistically doesnt require you TO charge it, but if that's the case, I dont understand why it exists to begin with if it's not going to be usable for whatsoever if only to bait less experienced players into using something so lackluster that puts them at a disadvantage. I always love the idea of heavy weapons in any game I play, but this seriously misses the mark for an otherwise really polished set of weapons.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game that for whatever reason doesn't have a 4 player bundle, definitely worth it on sale to even play with friend's on steam's \"online local play\" system, but for something on par with Hades or even Gungeon, the scale is not there when it comes to items, maps, or unlockables.

that, but: [i]if you haven't gotten your fill of Hades, just play Hades instead[/i]. I also only had the chance to play single-player, so maybe the game is super-great with multi but idk.\n\nI don't think the game has the staying power of Hades both due to the fact that there's no meaningful story or interesting progression as well as the fact that the \"heat\" system seems badly designed in comparison to the incremental rewards Hades would give you.\n\nThe game is technically much more challenging than Hades, which isn't a con, but it does make it harder to start a run knowing the effort that I'll have to put in. There's just so many enemies with low windups and ranged attacks that if you don't have a build with the damage to close down enemies quickly, you may find yourself dodging for significant portions of the fight even without any difficulty modifiers and this game isn't super forgiving about healing.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd recommend this game to anyone who is waiting for Hades 2 and otherwise not.",

"language": "english", "review": "I love this game and it's fantastic. I've never written reviews so my writing will be poor but I will give it a go as I genuinely appreciate this game.\n\nFrom having experience in an arsenal of unique genres and loads of MMOs and roguelites, I have to say I find the boss fights in this game very good. I genuinely think it's better than a lot of end-game MMO boss fights which is kind of ridiculous. They feel good to play, it can be difficult, it can be easier but never impossible and never annoying. It's not just random melee hits where the difficulty is a large number increase or whatever, just brilliant stuff.\n\nI haven't once felt like I was too weak to advance forward, nor having played co-op, though only with one more person and not with a full party, I didn't find that it felt either too easy or too hard changing between solo and duo play. The balance feels quite nice as well going into the various classes, some are certainly more powerful due to the nature these types of games play out and not necessarily due to balancing error. \n\nFor example, I'd argue the range classes in this game are superior but the biggest reason lies mainly in the fact that they are ranged and not that they are just stronger. The nature of the game is that there are enemies that are ranged and enemies that are melee, if you are range you're mainly only vulnerable to one of these but if you're melee you're within attack range of both of the opposing enemy types. Naturally a ranged class has the advantage in such situations therefore I find them to be stronger and usually is the case in a lot of these games. \n\nFrom my experience, if melee is relevant it's usually because there balance is poor and they are just too strong, however in this game I find melee feels just as strong as the ranged classes and in some cases they are better because some skills benefit you from being close up, plus all melee having natural cleave in their hits allow them to easily negate the disadvantage from being in the range of two enemy types rather than one.\n\nI also want to mentions the power-ups in this game, as with any roguelite game, basically shape and balance the whole thing. I'm sure there are perfect builds you can strive for, but I feel like even if you were only given (subjective) subpar options, you can still perform just fine, of course, combining these power-ups with things that could synergize will certainly make you stronger too. Additionally, while there are clear intended builds that are made to fit together in the game, you don't need to collect them all to be strong. You can mismatch between these intended builds just fine and depending on what skills you WANT to play (which is important because you don't feel obligated to pick any specific skills here, whichever you WANT to play is going to be the best in my opinion) you can build around it and you'll definitely be able to clear the game. \n\nI feel like in these times of games where there's a lot of rather unremarkable games I happened to randomly stumble upon this gem and I'm going to keep enjoying it for a while.

It's easily worth $20 and an even better deal when it eventually goes on sale. \n\nThe major drawback I've noticed in my time with the game is the balance of the various modifiers. Most don't scale well into endless mode and the handful that do are essential for a good run. Additionally, some of the modifiers are so good that not getting them feels bad, for example, heal on crit. The game feels like it was balanced to some earlier point, likely before they added the later worlds and especially not endless mode. Which, is disappointing because I was have good fun with the game until I realized my dream of tearing through endless mode was entirely dependent on finding one specific modifier.\n\nAnyway, I had great fun and for anyone looking to have a great time with friends for 10ish hours, I highly recommend the game. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1692016986, "timestamp_updated": 1692016986, "voted_up":

visual effects are nice and the little bonus stars granted when you play multiplayer. It makes for a fun experience for sure with the right people.\n\n[b]What I like about this game: Multiplayer[/b]\n\nI like that drops are basically a free-for-all. When playing, if I think a stat orb or relic is better suited for someone else, I just give them all if so (and vice versa). It encourages one another to help build each other's synergies and builds, which is really fun. \n\nI love the [spoiler]surprise rooms like the offering room and the chest rooms.[/spoiler] They add some more fun to the game.\n\nThe sound effects and the art, again, are beautiful. I like the concept of \"perfect skills\" having bonus abilities too, it's made me basically a pro at using skills and so much fun to execute. Very rhythm-like at a certain point.\n\nthe speedrun rewards are also so fun and rewarding. It feels good! \n\n[b]My concerns about this game: It is overly frustrating, and not in a fun \"rogue-lite\" way.[/b]\n\nSome relics feel pointless to unlock. For example there are some that only work for the first attack you do in a room (which, feels so pointless when you're fighting a multitude of enemies. A one-time use for a room for a small bonus? it's a bit laughable.)\n\nThere's little to no reward for defeating a mini-boss, which they can be horribly overpowered for little payoff, so often my partner and I will just barely scathe through a room and be disappointed when nothing comes up for our work. Even if it was just little orbs I'd be happy honestly.\nAdditionally, the two sword rooms (?) are just enemies. No reward afterwards. It's probably to tell you it's just enemies but... It feels so unnecessary? Who would choose that? I find that a bit redundant.\n\nEspecially in the very last world [spoiler]when there are no relics, stat selector, etc avaliable! it is endless enemies and a horrible pain when everyone is dead and no one is revived even when you get to the boss.[/spoiler] it is unfortunately my least favorite part of this game, and all of the efforts made during the run feel so pointless just trying to sludge through to progress. which is not a good feeling to have for a roguelite. The big boss is just... the worst in my opinion. 2-3 shots and you're down. Feels like you can't progress in a run without healing or freezing abilities... And you end up just spectating if you're dead. Not as nice if one person is overly OP and everyone is very weak.\n\nThe movement in this game could be improved. I utilize a lot of the skills but struggle since you often have to stand still. I feel like the movement is a bit choppy for me in that regard. Or at least the UI makes it really difficult for me to understand what's going on the screen half the time. Sometimes I'm taken off guard by enemies that are hidden beneath health bars/skills which is frustrating. \n\nI wish there was a little more visual clarity, especially seeing what skills are available next to my character or something, since more times than not I confuse myself when trying to stay focused on where I am on the map vs seeing what abilities I can use. \n\nThe carry-on progression is okay, ember starts being less important as the game goes on. I do wish it had other uses (maybe it does and I haven't gotten to that point?) but if it offered healing that would be nice.\n\nYeah that's just a few of my concerns. As frustrated as I am with this game, I do really like the secrets and unlocking new colors. The world and it's characters are so cute and fun, so regardless I still enjoy playing when I do. I don't know if I'd play alone though, just with friends. Of course some of these issues might just be my own issues, I'm not a \"pro\" at playing rogue-lites but I still love to play them. I just wish there was a bit more balance.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691640316, "timestamp_updated": 1691640316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143751171": {"recommendationid": "143751171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963693929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4752, "last_played": 1705890321}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogando desde a beta, sempre gostei muito da pegada do jogo, agora que est\u00e1 pronto, me surpreendi, sensacional, jogabilidade, lutas, monstros, at\u00e9 o replay \u00e9 muito bom, jogo excelente.", "timestamp_created": 1691629397, "timestamp_updated": 1691629397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143747559": {"recommendationid": "143747559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059303342", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 2338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1180, "last_played": 1708893756}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es sublime, muy divertido, solo ya es muy divertido, pero con amigos es 10 veces mejor, tiene remote play asi que con que un amigo lo compre genial, es muy rejugable, muy dinamico al estilo de juego, 10 de 10", "timestamp_created": 1691623461, "timestamp_updated": 1691623461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143737326": {"recommendationid": "143737326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198436769808", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 674, "last_played": 1690723766}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubc0c\uc6c0", "timestamp_created": 1691610526, "timestamp_updated": 1691610526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143729198": {"recommendationid": "143729198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015218866", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1106, "last_played": 1701529486}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon rogue lite.

While there are not a ton of levels, the bosses have crazy variations that range from fairly simple to absolutely insane. \n\nHalf of my playtime was Solo and the other half was co-op with 2-4 players. Personally, I enjoy solo more for \"hardcore\" runs simply because it's all up to me, but co-op is incredibly fun with friends, especially when you look into doing stuff like giving specific stats to players with specific weapons. Nothing like giving 16 gems of wisdom to  the Nexal Staff user!\n\nI usually don't ever push for a \"completed\" game, but I'm going to with this one.

"review": "39h ! C'est ce qu'il m'aura fallu pour r\u00e9ussir les 44 succ\u00e8s de ce jeu et le finir a 100%.\n\nUNE CLAQUE ! Vraiment, ce jeu est addictif, fuyez si vous \u00eates faible d'esprit, vous lancez une game en vous disant vous avez 1h30 avant d'aller vous coucher et vous finissez par aller vous coucher a 5h du mat !\n\nJe ne pose que rarement des notes ou des test, mais ce jeu m'en a donner l'envie, surtout qu'il manque \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de mise en lumi\u00e8re vu tout ce qu'il apporte.\n\n***LES PLUS***\n\n- Un gameplay dynamique, et qui se renouvelle sans cesse, vous devenez de plus en plus fort, et cela se ressent, que ce soit dans la conception de votre build, de votre gameplay ou des futur features qui se d\u00e9bloques au fur et \u00e0 mesure, c'est un v\u00e9ritable tour de force, et une des principales qualit\u00e9s du titre\n- Le bestiaire, complet, vari\u00e9, et vous demandera un temps d'adaptation a chaque monde.\n- Les m\u00e9caniques se renouvellent assez r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement et demandent une bonne observation des ennemies.\n- Les boss sont cools, et les variantes tout autant.\n- La bande son est propre, et travaill\u00e9\n- Une coop online et offline un peu fouillis au d\u00e9but mais on arrive au bout de quelques heure \u00e0 bien s'y retrouver.\n- Des secrets plut\u00f4t bien cach\u00e9 et vous d\u00e9bloquant des features dans votre HUB\n- De nombreux skins diff\u00e9rents, que ce soit les armes ou les diff\u00e9rentes couleurs \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer\n- La dur\u00e9e de vie\n\n\n***LES MOINS***\n\n- La dur\u00e9e de vie pas assez longue ! Enfin... 39h c'est plus que correct, mais comme toute bonne s\u00e9rie que vous avez ador\u00e9, la fin vous laisse un go\u00fbt amer... Vous en voudrez plus, toujours plus. J\u2019esp\u00e8re que des mises \u00e0 jour viendront compl\u00e9ter le titre, j'y reviendrais avec plaisir.\n- Une histoire un peu beaucoup anecdotique, semblable \u00e0 ses concurrents Roguelite\n\n\n***LA CONCLUSION***\n\nComme vous plus haut, le jeu \u00e0 \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de points positifs, et peu de n\u00e9gatifs, la courbe de progressions est bonne et superbement bien ma\u00eetris\u00e9, vous offrant une rejouabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9nu\u00e9e de frustration. La coop offre un plus non n\u00e9gligeable, progresser et d\u00e9buter avec ses amis offre un plaisir satisfaisant, o\u00f9 l'on discute de son avanc\u00e9 avec ses mates, on refait la run pour voir comment l'am\u00e9liorer et c'est cool. En bref, ce jeu m'a conquis moi et mes deux amis avec qui j'aurais partag\u00e9 une bonne partie de mon \u00e9pop\u00e9e. N'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 vous y plonger avec vos amis ou en solo, pour son prix (14.99\u20ac en promo) je n'en suis pas du tout d\u00e9\u00e7u.\n\n\nJe note ce jeu \u00e0 la note de 9/10, un must have dans sa biblioth\u00e8que de jeu. C'est un grand OUI pour ce jeu, et je tire mon chapeau (fictif) aux d\u00e9veloppeurs qui signe un titre magistral, qui m\u00e9riterait bien plus de succ\u00e8s qu'il n'en a actuellement.\n\n\nMerci

Biggest gripe I have is when farming character colors (for achievements), I'm either extremely unlucky or the spawnrate for the \"achievement event\" is very low. I'm on my 15th run and can't find 2 of the randomly-spawned areas to get the character colors. After completing the game with a packed 10-15hrs of nonstop new content, the additional 6 hours I just spent grinding for the 2 last achievements has been extremely monotonous as I need to keep grinding until stage 2 and stage 4 for the chance of certain events to occur. Every time I get to the boss of the area without these events occurring, I get more and more irked.

The interactions with the robot and the NPC for skill upgrades were too brief; it would have been better if they were more extended throughout the game's progression. I found myself finishing a run, talking to the relic NPC, and immediately starting another run, which felt a bit disheartening.\n\nOn the positive side, the interactions with the food items were great \u2013 I really enjoyed that aspect. If the same level of creativity were applied to relic/skill synergies, the game would be excellent! Ultimately, it's an enjoyable game to play, and achieving 100% completion isn't overly difficult.

world, it's not perfect.\nBelow is my opinion about the mechanics and gameplay feeling.\n\n- Catchy and addicting - Once you finish most of the unlocks the games become easier and you can go into crazy builds that make the runs easy\n- Variety of builds - you can chose from multiple builds (fire, poison, ice, lightning) to finish the game multiple times\n- Smooth graphics and cool concept - at some point you can get so strong you can loop win indefinitely (if the game doesn't crash)\n- Still has more to offer as I haven't mastered it or finished it 100%, so I can get more from it.\n\nA list with what I would improve in a random order:\n\n1 Most animations can't be skipped after seeing them at least once. been here 100 times.\n-> please let me skip them, including the one finishing the biome under the reward time limit. Make the reward to stay there and if you get over the time, it's gone or locked or flies away.\n\n2 Rewards for killing bosses don't feel rewarding enough, \n-> you could make like a spin the wheel that either gives money, embers, skills or relics. you can insert gold or embers to increase the chance to get something better (just a thought)\n\n3 You can't recycle food or items you don't need\n-> I have builds where I don't need food or new items, however I have to waste them just because\n\n4 items that can be broken to give gold in some locations seem to be purposely placed so you might miss them, others give way too little gold, other entire levels seem to be void of gold (3rd and 4th biome mostly)\n-> I know there are items that can help with costs (money after killing mobs or the coupon) but it's not an option to always hunt for them.\n\n5 Tooltips dont show how much damage abilities do\n-> I can see a poison effect applies 1 stack, for how long and how much damage? Percentage damage increase \n\n6 Way too few levels and the randomness (if any) is minimal. Not to mention the last level has actually no rewards, shops. \n-> Being a small team is not an excuse. you wouldn't buy a car without steering wheel or seats because they are a small company, on the promise they will deliver them on a later date.\nDon't get me wrong, I understand the effort, I appreciate any content however do it right.\n\n7 The inability to save the current progress in a run and come back later and resume play.\n-> If I start playing I have to commit to it, there is no going back. Would be nice to be able to save in a middle of an endless run, go to sleep, come back the next day and continue.\n\n8 Mobs debuffs on player. They can keep you rooted and get chain rooted and get hit and can't escape and die.\n-> it's not fun to get chained hit by abilities and can't do anything. Make me spam a button or break the constrains with specific combination or keys.\n\n9 Sometimes the current room ends in a door and I don't even know what's behind it.\n-> make all doors to have icon available showing description and even bosses should have two doors. Normal boss with normal rewards and harder boss with bigger rewards.\n\nOverall I enjoy this game, it's addictive, fun and at some point challenging. Bit too short, bit too unrefined.\nIt's a gem still being cut, but please make the correct ones and don't botch it.", "timestamp_created": 1690788995, "timestamp_updated": 1690788995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143127013": {"recommendationid": "143127013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185905554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1710358680}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc81c \ud734\uac00\uac00 \ub179\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \u3137\u3137", "timestamp_created": 1690781137, "timestamp_updated": 1690781137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143125616": {"recommendationid": "143125616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174177083", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1965, "last_played": 1710227090}, "language": "english", "review": "Up there with some of the better roguelites.

I do not like the fifth area; it's a festering hell hole and it makes me shake with rage when I am not running a crit leech build. To get to the last boss you have to put all these modifiers on that will make the game a lot tougher which is a welcome change. I 100% the game and got all of the achievements so My biggest complaint is that it's really short. 5 levels plus the last final boss is not enough. Endless mode is alright because you can continue the game with the same build but that's it, nothing else except doing those 5 levels over and over. \n\nThe last boss itself is not enough why is he throwing mini-bosses at me that can be easily killed off and offer no challenge, If it was the Bosses I think it would be amazing and the last boss is easy if he  had gained all the previous bosses abilities it would make me really have to remember and work for the ending. it will take the average gamer at least 10 to 15 hours to really beat the game and that's it. If this could get some bonus levels with more risk reward and I also feel like the perk tree is really limiting me if I get all those upgrades why can't I just have them all you literally put 20,000 points into it and get like a few. It also needs some better perks for the weapons I have unlocked most of the upgrades and they feel good when you have a synergy going on but other than that some outshine the others and it really feels underwhelming. \n\nI would love to see more in-game events with fun mini games or Fights that offer like a perk for the entire run. I would really wait for more content in the game that improves upon it and makes me want to replay it.

I play games with a few friends online and the same league games got really stale and we were looking for something new. We really liked castle crashers and have always wanted something with the similar multiplayer functionality and this game overfilled that hole completely. The combat style is very much like Hades but the game feels very castle crashers like with the chaotic enemies, spells, and attacks flying around the screen at all times.\n\nMy friends and I became hooked instantly, me especially. I bought this game 2 days ago at the time of writing this and I have already logged around 16 ish hours. The game gives you 3 save files so you can have one for one group of friends, another for a personal world, and an extra on top of that. For the sale price of $11 or $12 that we bought it at, this game is worth way more. I would seriously pay $30 or more for this excellent adventure that is packed into this game.\n\nMy only real critique of this game as the beginning feels very slow. Like slower than normal for a rouge like. You don't have many relic, weapon, or spell options and I wish the progress was a little faster. But after unlocking 2-4 weapons, the progression begins to even out into a normal level. And as soon as you pass that hurdle, the game just gets even better. The replay value is through the roof as there is almost always new enemy variants to unlock or just new things to discover as you keep playing. \n\nThis game is good enough as a solo game, but it just gets even better with friends. The game supports up to 4 players, but I have only played with three. There is enough loot to go around but the loot is free for anyone to take so some theft tends to happen from time to time. But this also allows the necessary loot to go to the right people. For example, the gems that give you more max health, is fun to give them to the tanky player to allow them to keep tanking damage as a front line. Or just give one player all the crit chance in the world.\n\nI really hope that everyone can give this game a chance someday. It is very worth the price point for the excellent replay-ability. If the devs decide to make dlc for this game, I would happily buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1690475265, "timestamp_updated": 1690475265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

This review WILL be long, so my TL:DR for the people who are just browsing the reviews for this game is:\n\nGreat graphics, gameplay and customisation\nRough enemy scaling, difficulty and a bit of imbalance\nForgettable story and music.\nOdd performance issues here and there.\n\nStarting with the positives, the game looks great and I thoroughly enjoyed all of the games locales and sprites. The gameplay and customisation go hand in hand and are both really smooth, every weapon feels good to use and serves a purpose, the upgrades they and your Ember Knight can acquire through gameplay feel like upgrades and improvements and by far my favourite thing about the game is the constant flow of progression and synergies. It was only in about the last two hours of game time that I finished collecting all of the game's relics (in level powers) and I still felt I was consistently earning resources for upgrades and other buffs.\n\nA gripe I have with most other rougelites is that the grind feels incredibly daunting, with the hundreds, sometimes thousands of items, equipment and buffs, that all have unique unlock methods while only granting minor improvements. It's overwhelming and results in moments when after I've dropped the game for something else after a good many hours spent playing it, I feel I barely got into it at all. Ember Knight doesn't suffer this problem, every Relic is at the very least beneficial and the amount that clock into that region I can count on one hand. The game both encourages you and provides you with the ability from the start of the run to specialise your setup with a few different base builds such as: ice, fire, poison, electricity, AOE, stun, healing, etc. which all have an expansive level of depth, that can also be built on one another without drawbacks to create some incredibly busted (feeling, I will get to the issues later) builds that happens all organically. The game makes building your character feel more gratifying with every single Relic, stat upgrade and skill you collect to fine tune your play style to however you want. The one complaint I have with strictly the gameplay is that the general method of dealing with enemies is the same, you aim to stun them making them unable to do anything, wail on them and then try to repeat until they're dead. The only other issue I have is that bosses can be annoying and mini bosses too easy.\n\nNow to get to the negatives (and to be a bit of a hypocrite), the game's difficulty really needs some polish. Not counting the difficulty options you unlock after your first completed run, the game's difficulty ramp turns into a spike. The first 3 worlds are generally fine, some encounters end up far tougher than the general flow of the level but it's only occasional, but the fourth and fifth worlds have major problems with enemy health, damage, speed and numbers and types. The increase in challenge isn't my issue, my issue is the fact it comes out of nowhere. It feels like there's supposed to be another world between the third and fourth compared to the gradual climb of the previous levels, but the game just throws you into the deep end with some incredibly obnoxious enemies that highlight two major issues I have with the game.\n\nThere are 5 types of character stats you level up as you play: Health, Damage, Skill Damage, Critical Chance and Agility. My main issue is with the health and damage stats and it's due to the enemy scaling. As you progress through a single world I do think that there is an noticeable increase in your abilities while levelling these stats up, but when you reach a new world it feels like you get factory reset. At this point I don't feel stronger, I feel like I've just been dragged back to where I was at the start of the last world. I understand that enemies are supposed to hit harder and take more hits, but it becomes obnoxious if I've spent the world levelling up my health and as soon as I reach the next one I still take the same amount of hits to die as I did for the majority of the previous level. It's issues like this that cause my second major issue with the game and that's the \"forced\" play style.\n\nIf you are playing on (what is basically) the NG+ mode with the customisable difficulty options you are pretty much forced down one of two paths and one of those is far superior. Ice is by far the strongest setup in the game at this moment for three key reasons: 1. It's main gimmick is freezing, which makes sense for ice, but the best way to handle enemies in this game is to stun/immobilise them, which Ice does both of incredibly easily. 2. Ice has the second most spells dedicated to it with 2.5, which doesn't sound like much, but when you max out at 2 equipable spells that means it can quite easily be all you need to run, not to mention both spells are incredibly strong. And 3. Ice has a benefit no other element synergy has, with the right Relic it grants life steal on defeated frozen enemies. If the other elemental abilities had this, this wouldn't be an issue, but because of this one relic, the other options aren't even as close to as good. I have run multiple runs with as many fine tuned builds as possible for each element alone, not mentioning sub genres, which wasn't even close to the average build I could get for ice. The other options are fun and satisfying, but no way near as reliable as ice. The only option that came even close wasn't even an elemental build, it was an armour build, which literally focuses around you gaining temporary health to increase your survivability which is still an issue. The other systems are just objectively inferior and they feel it, which when the game has such an incredible fun and in depth sandbox as this game is really annoying.\n\nNow for the odd bits that fall into neither category, story and music didn't really stand out to me. I didn't expect the story to be 5 stars and it's completely serviceable but nothing special. I genuinely cannot remember a single song of the top of my head from this game, it's fine and fits but I don't remember anything from it. Performance was a fairly frequent issue for me, both in single player and multiplayer, the game never crashed, but freezing was a constant, incredibly frustrating issue and I have no idea what caused it most of the time aside from a couple times where it seemed to be due to a group of enemies that were about to spawn. If any devs decide to read this PLEASE fix this.\n\nIn conclusion, despite my critique of the game, it was a good time. It has balance issues, some due to enemy scaling, other due to OP builds, and dependent on how die hard you are for the rougelite it might not offer as much content as you are used to, but I wouldn't have gone for 100% if I didn't enjoy the game. I really hope it continues to do well and if there's any new content planned in the future for this game I look forward to it.", "timestamp_created": 1690396364, "timestamp_updated": 1690396364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142847128": {"recommendationid": "142847128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042601553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1097, "last_played": 1690678818}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and fun to play 4 person coop", "timestamp_created": 1690394063, "timestamp_updated": 1690394063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142845237": {"recommendationid": "142845237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826078757", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 987, "last_played": 1710389740}, "language": "english", "review": "The weird Frankenstein's Monster Mash-Up of Hades and Four Swords Adventures.\n\nYou'll not only be helping your fellow knights but competing against them as well to grab all the loot get the highest score.\n\nThere's at least 6 different weapons each with 9 different and changeable attributes, allowing you to customize to your playstyle.\n\nPlus more 45+ Skills and Relics allowing for moment I can't describe here. \n\nthis game is just awesome fun.

It follows the adventures of Ember Knights, warriors defending the universe from the evil sorcerer Praxis. The gameplay is reminiscent of Castle Crashers and Gauntlet, with randomly generated maps and challenging enemies. You collect coins and Ember to unlock upgrades and weapons, making each run more manageable. The game's currency system adds depth to the gameplay, and the Ember Tree allows for permanent character upgrades. The combat is fun and exciting, and the game's replayability is impressive.\n\nThe art style is charming, and the universe is interesting.

It has its ups and downs, but it's definitely worth a buy if you've got someone to play with!\n\n+++Pros+++\n+Solid pixel art style with expressive characters and enemies. Everything is well telegraphed because of how clear the animations are.\n+Very clearly designed for multiplayer. It accounts for sharing resources, letting you make tons of microdecisions and feels like working together towards a goal.\n+Controls are very tight and satisfying. Pulling off combos with your skills or friends is a lot of fun.\n+Excellent sound design, especially sound effects.\n\n---Cons---\n-Singleplayer is not nearly as fun. The game is a lot trickier unless you know which relics lead you to broken builds that make the game too easy. Difficulty is not balanced for one player.\n-The story is incredibly generic and boring. No big surprises, no interesting characters. I basically skip through every text box.\n\nThe cons aren't really that big a deal, in my opinion. The gameplay is fun and that's really all you need.

The character's are very snappy and responsive, which I believe is important for any good rogue-lite where the goal is to not be hit. The weapons feel unique. The environments are decently varied. There are quite a few builds and you have a fairly consistent method of making a build once you start getting more unlocks. \nMy only problem is that, sometimes in multiplayer it feels easy to lose sight of your character. Other player's effects can just be so distracting that it becomes hard to see the dangerous things the enemies are doing. Oh also, any player effect that causes knockback is incredibly frustrating for everyone else as they just zip around effectively kidnapping an enemy you were fighting and denying you on kill effects or charges to abilites. Super annoying and there's nothing to be done about it because they're just playing the game.\nThe game plays fine in solo, but is definitely less fun that way.

If you're a solo looking for a solid rogue-lite, this is fine but isn't quite there yet. Its short, poorly balanced, and lack replayability. I'm sure it's just v1.0 awkwardness. A lot of other great rogue-lites also had this problem.\n\nThe Good:\n- Co-op rogue-lites are great and there should be more of them. This aspect carries the game.\n\nThe Meh:\n- There's nothing really driving me to come back and play more. You can 100% the game really quickly and there isn't a system that rewards replaying the game beyond that point.\n\n- Unlocks are hidden solely behind number of enemies killed which makes sense for a co-op game but is a bit boring.\n\nThe Bad;\n- Items and weapons are poorly balanced. You get a sense of what's good and what's terrible really quickly.\n\n- Lack in play-style diversity. Almost every weapon has a charge attack, but most items don't work with charge attacks at all. So builds either boil down to heavy skill usage or just spamming the attack button. It completely removes the nuances between the different weapons because you're better off just spamming attack and not thinking about gimmicks that don't work or punish you for trying them.\n\n- There's a system that lets you spend in-game resources to RNG your way into perfect starting items. Its quite easy to farm for said resource and it trivializes the game because you can just pick the best 4 items to start with for any given build.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690131169, "timestamp_updated": 1690131169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142653508": {"recommendationid": "142653508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040864478", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1690710855}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u932f\u73a9\u7684\u904a\u6232", "timestamp_created": 1690130603, "timestamp_updated": 1690130603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142652512": {"recommendationid": "142652512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844630341", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1268, "last_played": 1708417125}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4fee\u6539\u95ee\u9898\u5341\u5206\u53ca\u65f6\uff0c\u597d\u8bc4", "timestamp_created": 1690129387, "timestamp_updated": 1701439117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1690403121, "developer_response": "Hello,\n\nWe've released a couple of patches that should fix any instances of getting stuck.

If you don't know, Hades is a fantastic hack 'n slash roguelite dungeon crawler that set the bar for the genre a few years back. Ember Knights is extremely similar to Hades, in fact it has some nearly identical mechanics. The weapons are very similar, the room-based pick-your-next-reward system is practically identical, relics power up your existing abilities just like boons, you eventually unlock an intricate & modular difficulty customization system...I could keep going, but I think I've made my point.\n\nNot that this is bad that Ember Knights practically ripped off Hades' formula, by any means. The fact that it's multiplayer where Hades wasn't, and yet it replicates the satisfying gameplay of Hades without much sacrifice (other than the story, but you typically don't play multiplayer games like this for the story), is a big selling point. Definitely better with friends, there's a lot of fun to be had in partying up and working together here.\n\nThe pixel art looks great, the weapons all feel satisfying to use (and they seem to strike a good balance between satisfying VFX and not clogging up your screen with explosions, which is something Hades struggled with. Very important when there can be up to 4 of you swinging swords at once), and there's a good amount of extras and upgrades to unlock between runs.

Way harder than Hades and many other rouge likes However, at the same time, I would recommend this rouge-lite for anyone new the genre, specifically because it is multiplayer, and the multiplayer works quite well!\n\n\nThe Good Things\n\n- Excellent multiplayer. Players can play on their game or with others and group up later. Everything connects and works seamlessly.\n\n- a TON of build diversity. Stack poison, cause things to explode and chain the poison element to others; throw chakrams that freeze targets when hit, that chains to a ton of other enemies with a 100% critical chance against frozen targets; or wield a sword that has 100% burn chance on enemies, while above 75% health, which brings a ton of builds online, but be careful to not get hit to much!\n\n- Charming little story, with a pleasing art style. Nothing crazy here, just visually pleasing. Most of the cut scenes in this game are actually on the latter half of the game to reward the player for getting this far. Which is a nice touch. \n\n- Game play is top notch. If you exclude all the abilities and just focus on the weapons alone, there could be enough here to roast some marsh mellows and them some. \n\n\nThe Bad Things\n\n- Super lack of healing items in this game, especially when it is needed, like before a certain boss.

The game, in a vacuum, is amazing.  Visually gorgeous, simple and fluid action mixed with complex engaging encounters, compelling game-play that makes you want to try just one more run every time, technically fluid, and a definite love for gaming poured into development.  \n\nBut there just lacks content for a genre that requires a breadth of content to excel.  Games like this, built to be played over and over again in bursts, requires FAR more diversity than this offers.  Which is incredibly frustrating because at its core there is potential to be on the mount everest of stellar indie titles here.  So much potential.  But after sitting in early access for a year and a half, for a game as glowingly praised through development as it was, Ember Knights just doesn't have a shred of the diversity that makes other games of the genre stick out so much. I was going to grab this game when it first hit early access but having an unhealthy amount of hours into the action roguelike genre I knew that in order to really enjoy it I would have to wait for more meat on the bone.  Dead Cells, for example, was always a fundamentally phenomenal experience but you definitely needed to wait till it was fleshed out to experience what makes it so iconic. I honestly am surprised at the lack of content here.  So much so that I felt compelled to write a rare review.   \n\nThere are only a small handful of enemies per world, maybe 4-5?  And at 5 worlds thats really, save for a few rare encounters, 25 enemies you're going to see all game.  After just a few runs the first worlds feel more cumbersome than enjoyable.  17 abilities and 6 weapons doesn't sound incredibly lack luster but it also doesn't bring a lot to the table.  And truthfully many of the abilities feel same-y enough that they aren't going to change your gameplay.  Its close though, its close!!  I feel like some tweeking to the abilities and weapons could make them feel different enough but even then my criticism is the breadth of it all.  There's just not enough.  You can pretty much bank on getting whatever ability you want pretty immediately and takes away from the whole feeling of needing to work with what you find.\n\n\nWhen playing games like this, Hades, Dead Cells, Curse of the Dead Gods, Undermine, Gunfire Reborn, or honestly any of the rouglike's with heavy meta-progression, the appeal is in \"ooooo what will this run be like!\".  At the time of writing this, most runs are going to feel very very same-y in Ember Knights.

The game I'm speaking about today is one of these rare cases that shine with their careful design and engaging gameplay. It's a piece of work that's just as captivating to experience solo as it would be to share with friends.\n\nFrom the get-go, the solo experience plunges you into a fantastic adventure, filled with challenges, mysteries, and astonishing encounters. The graphics are stunning, the scenery breathtaking, each detail finely crafted to create an immersive atmosphere.\n\nExploring this vast world is a thrilling adventure, with secrets hidden away that push you to delve deeper. The gameplay is smooth, the controls intuitive, and the balance between difficulty and progression is perfectly mastered.\n\nBut beyond the technical aspect, it's the feeling of solitude that makes this game so special. It's not a burdensome solitude, but rather a form of freedom, an opportunity to lose oneself in a fantastical universe. It's in this world that we realize how one can be both happy and sad, satisfied and unsatisfied, all while being alone.\n\nHowever, despite all this splendor and rich emotions, a shadow looms over my gaming experience. It's the absence of a friend to share this adventure with. This game is a work of art that deserves to be experienced by two, to be shared and discussed. The prospect of living this epic adventure alone saddens me, because I know the joy of discovery would be doubled if it were shared.\n\nEach victory, each discovery, each moment of pure wonder is tinged with a hint of melancholy. Because every time I achieve a feat or unlock a new world, I turn to share my joy, and instead, I find emptiness.\n\nIn the end, this game is a treasure, a masterpiece that I highly recommend. It's perfect for solo players, but it's also a beautiful world that would benefit from being shared. If only my friend understood how much the experience could be enriched by their presence...\n\nSo yes, I'm playing this game all alone and it's really good. But every victory is also a reminder of the solitude. It's a game for two, played by one.\n\nEDIT : Really hope for a DLC in the future.

Snappy combat, dodge roll with invincibility frames, nice selection of weapons with lots of abilities to unlock between runs.  Weapons can also be modded for more variety.  Mini-bosses have several variants which are randomly selected each run, making the run itself more varied.\n\nThe game plays very similarly to Hades, but with a much cuter art style and Co-op!  Couch coop is quite fun, as is online co-op.  The devs keep updating it with new weapons and new worlds, so every time it gets updated I can jump back in and play more.  \n\nI do wish I could collect Ash (weapon modding currency) when I already have everything unlocked.  Then I'd be able to instantly unlock new weapon mods when they get added.  However I get that it's probably done this way on purpose so when new weapons are released, it's incentive to play new runs to unlock all the mods for the new weapon.\n\nOtherwise, great game.  Runs feel varied enough to keep it fresh with a large selection of abilities and relics, and once you beat the game you can up the difficulty if you wish.

The game has a lot of variety and replay value, thanks to the different weapons, skills, relics, and enemies that you can encounter. The game also has a compelling story and lore, and we are looking forward to more content coming out for this game.\n\nThe only negative criticism I have is that the maps get too big for screen sharing towards the end and boss fights.

This was a minor inconvenience, but it was worth it to experience the game in its full glory.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Ember Knights to anyone who loves action rogue-lites, pixel graphics, and co-op games.

They added new ones for the newest update and they are not even relevant at all. \"hit X times perfectly with a weapon\", \"finish a run on X difficulty with X weapon\", etc. All of these could have been included in the original release, but instead they decided to add them later on to screw off people and force them to invest more hours into this title.\n\n\nFirst off: the game starts weak, really weak.\nA) You have a row of relics which are fine on their own. But there is no real build diversity at this point of the game.\nB) Difficulty of enemies seems a bit off. Certain enemies in Area 2 feel stronger than on Area 3 and even 4. But that's only till you learn their patterns. Which is quite normal for this kind of game/genre.\nC) Many game mechanics are locked behind certain NPC you encounter at certain stages. It should take you 2 runs to area 4 to unlock most facilities.\n\nOnce you are done with that... the real gameplay starts. It's enjoyable.\n\nIf you played Hades you will see a few similarities.\n\nYour \"main\" weapon is selected in the HUB. You can Upgrade the weapon later on and even select different Augments for it. I believe they were done quite good.\n\nYou can find Spells during your run, you can have 2 at once on you. I enjoy the spell design but I would like to see way more variety.\n\nA run takes around 25~40 minutes depending on how well you do. If you do really well you can lower your time even more but that's more of an exception. It saves most changes nearly instantly but you can not take a break and return to a previous run, it counts as an fail once you exit the game.\n\nEnemy design is quite good.

Have not tried out the multiplayer as of yet. My only complaint is that twin stick is not an option and could be possible if skills could be rebound to different buttons like on a gamepad, skill 1 and 2 could be bound to shoulder buttons in order to utilize the right thumbstick for turning. As of writing this review there is only a button to stand in place. This is somewhat helpful because if you que up a skill while moving you turn with the direction of the stick so standing in place focuses your aim. Again, using a second stick to turn would mitigate this issue but I'm sure it's been brought up throughout early access so I'm not really sure what the devs excuse is. Still recommend this game as the combat is fun and I'm sure multiplayer adds to the fun factor.", "timestamp_created": 1689846110, "timestamp_updated": 1689846110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142457800": {"recommendationid": "142457800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248392658", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 894, "last_played": 1695563208}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5c0f\u4f19\u4f34\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u5c31\u66f4\u597d\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1689846057, "timestamp_updated": 1689846093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142454035": {"recommendationid": "142454035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872132624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 665, "last_played": 1695398807}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9!

Unfortunately, the developers thought that it was a good idea to force players to adopt weapon/skill synergies by making fake-RNG rerolls that repeat the options they want you to use (they admitted to this in the Discord). This means that the game is discouraging you from being creative with builds and finding your own way. This is completely against the spirit of a roguelike/roguelite game and stuff like this is why I'm so hesitant to play new rogue games (some developers are so stubborn); I find it to be a very disingenuous approach to developing a game for this genre.\n\nIf they changed this (or at least started listening to the general playerbase) then I would gladly play again. In a roguelike, I don't care if I get bad rolls if there is real RNG (to me that is fair), but if the game is actively working against me (in my opinion) and pretending to use RNG or trying to \"lean the RNG a little more in [my] favor\" and I get consistently bad rolls because of this, then it doesn't feel very fun to me. The core gameplay, art, and different abilities are great, but the fake RNG is a massive turn off for me personally. I've had the same relics/skills appear on the 1, 3, and 5 rerolls multiple times. When there are 17 skills, this shouldn't be happening when there are only 2 skill options per roll. I know some people won't agree, but that's my opinion on it.\n\nI also think that the developers listened to player feedback very little during the early access period and pretty much just did what they felt like doing from the beginning.

Only 1 new weapon which isn't all that different from some of the other \"fast-hitting\" melee type weapon\n\n- Also the new weapon's hitbox is little janky. I would swing at an object right in front of me but the hit doesn't register in certain situations.\n\n- The final level design is very basic and feels tacked on/rushed. It's just couple rooms before the final boss. No items, no shops. I think the last couple normal fights should still offer rewards.\n\n- Some of the boss variants do not feel difficult but rather cheap. There are some attacks that immobilize you and then there is a subsequent attack coming right afterwards. This means that if you get hit by the first one, there is absolutely no way of mitigating the subsequent damage because you can't move, attack or use your skills. This feels weird because with 1.0 patch, freezing was nerfed where players can no longer perma-freeze the enemies but the enemies can to an extent while dishing out heavy damage.\n\n- My biggest gripe with the 1.0 release and the final boss content is that if you want to get the true ending, you have to play at difficulty \"Doom.\" While the game isn't impossible to beat at this level  if you have everything unlocked, I have absolutely no clue why the developers decided to do this. This is literally gate-keeping main content of the game to a pretty extreme level. Just have an achievement for beating the game at the highest difficulty, don't keep the main content of the game and the ending away from the players with this BS. SPOILDER ALERT: [spoiler]The true final boss isn't even that difficult. Some minibosses or normal enemies are tougher[/spoiler]\n\nNow here are some general non 1.0 related issues:\n- While there are variety of different types of weapons, lot of them play similarly. Especially the melee weapons with the exception of the hammer. All of the weapons have upgrades and different movesets but they are very underwhelming to use and not very build defining. I think the weapon upgrades and alt-fire needs some rework or have relics that focus on them to make them useful\n\n- Not enough relics throughout your run. Unless you're playing in endless mode and looping through the game several times, you're not going to find that many relics to really have a crazy wacky build unless you very lucky and hit every single relic you need. On average, I found myself finding about 10-13 relics per run. I think one of the biggest appeal of roguelike games like this is the amount of possibly gambreaking OP builds you can try. However because the game is so stingy with the relics, the game is already over by the time you feel like your build is just starting to come together. Offering more relic rooms or at least giving us the option of rerolling the next room (like in Hades) would make this so much better. Relics are what makes the game like this fun.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1689755336, "timestamp_updated": 1689755336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142392553": {"recommendationid": "142392553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076780920", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1143, "last_played": 1690184549}, "language": "english", "review": "bro u like play as this little fire guy and he kicks butt", "timestamp_created": 1689755186, "timestamp_updated": 1689755186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 49, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741769313812255859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142392051": {"recommendationid": "142392051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081789379", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1689921604}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u666e\u666e\u901a\u901a...\u524d\u5169\u500b\u5c0f\u6642\u883b\u6709\u65b0\u9bae\u611f\u7684 \u5169\u5c0f\u6642\u5019\u6709\u9ede\u7121\u804a", "timestamp_created": 1689754343, "timestamp_updated": 1689754343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142390281": {"recommendationid": "142390281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119747639", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1689751433}, "language": "english", "review": "Game's alright, nothing special.

This is an extremely charming and minimalist approach to the genre and it does it without a single flaw in design. The single player and co-op play is pristine. It's very fun, there's a lot of variance in the runs, there's many ways to build characters and the relic interactions can become very spicy. Calling it \"Hades meets Castle Crashers\" isn't an inaccurate comparison.\n\nThe only two issues I have right now is that, first, the colorblind support is poor; red warning AoE markers are low contrast, thin, and don't last long so if you miss the initial flash of the attack, you are going to have a very hard time if you're red-green colorblind. It doesn't ruin the experience but it's definitely a frustration.\n\nSecond, I can't take local players into online games with me. There may be intentional reasons for this, but it made it hard to play with friends when I had either my sibling with me, or someone from Remote Play Together, and we wanted to join my other friends online. This isn't a massive flaw, but it was a disappointment.\n\nIt's worth noting those are my ONLY two disappointments I experienced in my 7 hours of playing. This game has clear polish, and plenty of content to fill it in. Nothing feels empty, and the game is fast paced enough that you see a large variety of the content quickly so it doesn't feel stale or slow. The rate you unlock things seems respectably fast.\n\nThis may in turn make the \"end game\" arrive too soon and the content drought might be real, but for the moment? I don't care.

"language": "english", "review": "I purchased this game in early access and have enjoyed the full extent of the development process. I waited with mounting anticipation for the 1.0 release and subsequent content drop, unfortunately the 1.0 patch is plagued with many of the issues that had been resolved in previous patches. This leads me to believe that the build of the game that has been released for 1.0 is a prior test build that wasn't subject to the various changes that happened in the time leading up to 1.0. \n\nThe game was very tightly controlled and well programmed. There are several weapons for the user to experiment with and customize to their play style. The upgrades are balanced and provide wonderful synergistic effects. The Co-op is a welcome addition. Though I play solo for most of my runs, this has the potential to be one of the greats in the Action Roguelike/Roguelite genres, taking its place along gems like Enter The Gungeon, Nuclear Throne, Binding of Isaac, and Hades. \n\nIt is unfortunate that the 1.0 is experiencing issues, but I'm sure that the team will get it right eventually. \n\nPresently the enemies will attack through the user's guard, they launch attacks even though they are stunned, the dodge won't protect from most AOE attacks and frequently the user's attacks are ignored as the enemies accumulate damage after their own attacks land. Here's hoping they'll fix the bugs and get back to excellence.\n\nAlthough I'd like to wholeheartedly recommend the experience, in its present state its a frustrating and stressful game that doesn't reward the time you've invested as the unlock-able abilities are not behaving correctly.\n\n\nEdit: I've played the 1.1 and unfortunately, while it does address the main portion of the bugs the balance on the new content's enemies just isn't there. The rest of the game has a gradual power creep and enemies that can be engaged and eliminated by players using each of the weapon options, but the endgame enemies are only manageable at range or by kiting. The Behemoths, Shades, Grimlins and Arbiters are too strong for the power creep and their projectile attacks consistently make it through my sword slashes when they're meant to be destroyed. I Cranked my Power stat to 97 and it still takes 8-10 hits to eliminate the larger enemies. I hope that things improve and some balance changes occur, but presently the game still needs work.", "timestamp_created": 1689692603, "timestamp_updated": 1690450887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534979581832885742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1689874188, "developer_response": "Hi there,\n\nWe haven't seen a lot of reports of issues with 1.0 but the few we have seen are being addressed in a hotfix update (1.0.1) that should be available tomorrow.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth had interesting interactions with passive picked up in a run, but the damage thresholds against endgame bosses was straight up not fun for me. Enter the Gungeon had too much bullet hell with little else going for it in terms of unlocking items for better chances of winning a run. Wizard of Legend was a cool concept with the wide variety of spells and satisfying spell combos but felt a little too slow for me. Hades was really solid with art, visual effects, and gameplay (which Ember Knights seems to take after very much), but for me, Hades had too much content locked behind completing multiple runs on higher difficulty which discouraged me from experiencing the full potential of each weapon with the gods' powers combined.\n\nEmber Knights pretty much hit all of these points being fast-paced enough, having enough variety of weapons, skills, or relics that influence your combat style each run, and several items and features being accessible after just a few runs. The feeling of the possible synergies experienced in different runs feels like achieving a dream build in The Binding of Isaac where the stuff you get all works together, except you experience these synergies much more frequently. The runs are a fair amount of time with successful runs being 30-35 minutes without the final world/boss which has yet to be included (you are actually encouraged to do each world under a time limit). As of end of Early Access, victory can be achieved very early in this game (I won a run before I had access to the shopkeeper prior to starting a run). For a roguelite, it has a much higher rate of successful runs compared to several others I've played. This can be a major downside for those who are into masocore or difficult games where it takes multiple failures or defeats and many hours before achieving something. And with the way items and features are unlocked, it does not take long before you acquire all there is available in the game. It may leave you wondering if it was worth the $20, even with the difficulty adjuster. These can be major deciding factors for those interested in this game but don't want it to be too easy.\n\nOverall, this game is good for dropping in by yourself or with others to simply have fun with synergies available in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1687232723, "timestamp_updated": 1687232723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763977885246276855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140363056": {"recommendationid": "140363056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338569314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 882, "last_played": 1707251341}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game i cant wait to see where it goes after 1,0 !! it would be great to see some synergies!!", "timestamp_created": 1687222568, "timestamp_updated": 1687222568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140358845": {"recommendationid": "140358845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290299946", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 15904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11739, "last_played": 1709594609}, "language": "english", "review": "I initially gave this review a positive, as I found it very enjoyable, to the point of putting a few hundred hours into it.

They inflated the difficulty of the fourth stage by removing the indicators of certain AOE attacks, and Netherra is a visual clutter that I dread playing through every time I reach that point of a 20 minute run. They added the ability for mobs at the brink of death to restore themselves to full HP and receive a buff, an otherwise interesting element if it didn't happen several times a room, every room. After a certain amount of Doom completions, they add more bore to the game than challenge, inflating the enemy hp and restricting the amount of relics you are allotted.

I only have good things to say. \n\nThe artstyle is adorable and the sound design is beautiful. very well done. \n\nThe gameplay is solid. when i die, i know it was because of my own mistakes or shortcomings, never because of a stupid/faulty/unresponsive control or game mechanic.\n\nThe game is slightly difficult, but the controls are easy to pick up and learn. Once you get that down its so much fun. But the mastering the game is totally different. It feels so good playing Ember Knights. Every time i successfully dodge or perfect a skill is pure dopamine. Very well designed, I cannot wait for the full release!\n\n\nThings to please keep:\n- The ember store in the nexus, as it keeps ember relevant and helps gives players a boost\n- SHOOOOP?... I love the \"shoooop?\" mechanics, please don't change that!\n- the lategame \"forge\" or class customization for weapons. it helps to prevent the game from growing too mundane/mono-tone. everyone loves just a little customization.\n- the ability to play split screen. some friends and I now have \"Ember Knight-Nights\" where we eat pizza and play this game for hours. non of us can wait for the full release!\n- the dash/dodge. I feel like that is a core mechanic of the game. to give it a longer cool-down would make the game needlessly unpleasant.\n\nThings to add/change:\n- maybe add more random rooms or encounters like the shoooop? or the mimic king. This is just more fun! I wouldnt want there to be too many though, and have it water down the other amazing special encounter rooms. So far what you guys have is great, i would want 1 or 2 more just to spice things up.\n- more colors!\n- if possible, more secret things to find and discover. This would add alot more excitement and motivation to explore and replay.\n- *spoiler warning!!* try to add a reward or bonus for players revisiting secret locations. example; that secret house in the third world that is only opened by a wisp. Its so cool! I was blown away when i first saw it, and i go inside whenever i replay it.

this game lack many things since it's still EA (in which i wouldn't complain about the content like weapons, relics, upgrades, etc.) so i like to suggest some things :\n\n1. have a \"return to Nexus (main hub)\" or a quick \"restart run\" option, so you don't bother get yourself killed to restart the run\n\n2. biome selection like Deadcells (this one kinda optional), after you beat a boss you can select the next biome, so it will work like a kind of variation and the run won't look plain and bland fighting same bosses one after another\n\n3. have some kind of blacksmith npc between room, work specifically for upgrading relics in your hand (i beat the game with only 1 level 2 relic) \n\n4. some kind of arcade or pvp.  well, why not? since this game is pretty fun with multiplayer thing anyway\n\nthat's what i have in mind. all in all, 10/10, best game worth every penny", "timestamp_created": 1683021446, "timestamp_updated": 1683021446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

incredibly fun to play and has an unbelievable level of dopamine from constantly upgrading yourself.\n\nthis is all singleplayer talk, but the game has the very unique attribute of multiplayer, and its really unlike any other roguelike/roguelite ive ever played\n\nthe way the game handles skills is genius, instead of placing them on a basic timer, in order to regen your skills you have to land attacks on enemies which is a very unique and refreshing way to play a roguelike, as well as charging being a universal feature on all skills, and if you release the moment it fully charges, you will get a \"Perfect\" skill which is much more powerful, not to mention the depth thats added with classes like the Wizard, who focuses a lot on skills and having the ability to recharge them the fastest via his multi-hit charge attack that hits in a cone infront of him\n\n the movement in this game is incredible, its so smooth and the dodge roll is super slick and feels incredible, and bosses are

It's controls are smooth, and its weapon choices offer a wide range of playstyles. Many of its bosses/minibosses are incredibly designed.  There is a wide variety of enemies and each has unique play patterns!  The game feels good.  However, there are two large issues with the game that cause me to give it a downvote (for now). One of those issues will likely be fixed by the addition of more content (I know this is early access), but my biggest gripe remains.\n\nThe first and biggest issue is that the game does not currently function like a roguelike.  I beat it on my 2nd try.  That should not be POSSIBLE with a roguelike.  Roguelikes should scale sharply and force you to make incremental progress combined with incremental growth. It's GOOD to die in a roguelike. It means you get to try new stuff and spend your ember!  Each playthrough should feel like you're making progress, but there should also be areas that far exceed your capacity.  Frankly, you start this game about 90% as powerful as you can be, so the incremental growth between sessions is so negligible that this game can hardly be called a roguelike.  I DONT WANT TO BE ABLE TO BEAT THE GAME on my 2nd playthrough. And multiplayer exacerbates this problem greatly...\n\nThe other problem is that there is a distinct lack of content.  Your choices and build options are heavily limited and you will see the same upgrades over and over.  I saw 6 shops throughout my playthrough and EVERY SINGLE ONE offered both frostwall and the lightning-static-field-upgrade.  This feels distinctly problematic in multiplayer because there is such lack of variety in the upgrades that almost everyone winds up on the same build path.  There is no diversity.\nAlso, for multiplayer can we make sure that no player can pick up more than 1 of the offered rewards per room?  If you're going to drop 1 reward per player, please just lock 1 reward per player. \n\n\n------\nAs to balancing... \nStatic field is absolutely broken, especially on archers and mages who can spam a bunch of attacks safely.  Frankly static field makes archers able to stun-lock large sections of any room.  2 archers with static field are effectively invincible against normal mobs.  This is not compelling gameplay. Perhaps give enemies invulnerability to cc for a second after being cc'd?\n\nFrozen wall is not a great spell, but it is the LITERAL only way to freeze things for the freeze build.  There need to be more freeze options.  Also make sure that freeze doesn't break the game the same way static field currently does.\n\nThere needs to be more lateral AND vertical growth at the ember tree.  Players should get significantly stronger. Not 6% stronger, but like 50% stronger (make enemies scale harder too). I want to feel like I can become substantially stronger than I am.\n Also, why give players 2 spells to start. Lock one of their spell slots so that they have an upgrade option for 2.  Also, one of the upgrade options has to be to give players an increased chance to see rare upgrades at the ember tree.  There's a lot of options for lateral growth (more powers, more dashes, more improvement options). Frankly, the enemies in this game are spot on. You dont need more/better enemies, you need more/better player improvements!  \n\nSkill builds are just bad right now. Either introduce some more synergies for skill-damage or buff the current stuff for skill-builds.\n\nOh last thought - please scale up multiplayer more. The difference in difficulty between 1p and 4p is ENORMOUS.", "timestamp_created": 1681058792, "timestamp_updated": 1682210108, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427793145179748535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136413075": {"recommendationid": "136413075", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043009370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1701871971}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich finde das Spiel pers\u00f6nlich gut und Lohnenswert!

The game play and random skills / spells are fantastic for replay ability. But there are def re tweeks needed like weapon balance and skill / spell. Example the Bow in game is by far the best weapon in the game. So much so that unless your just trying to just challenge yourself and not for the sake of in game progress you would be foolish to not take it. Same goes for certain spells and skill that i found myself using the reroll mechanic to try and fish for these specific ones. It has had a Hades feel to the game with the mechanics but missing the one thing that made Hades alot of fun for all weapon types \"IMO\" was enemies became stunned when hit. You you find out real fast that even with melee weps you find yourself trying to keep distance from enemies due to how fast their attacks can be including ranged ones. If your not lucky enough to find armor in the game you become almost a 3 shot every time and as a melee build its basically GG. I do hope in the future these things will be addressed as it is still in EA. The game is still suuuuper fun and even more fun when you have a friends with you.

Without spoiling too much of the content, I assure you that the price tag is well worth it for a game of this quality and STILL being under new updates. The upgrade system gradually allows you to build around your ideal play style, and the progression allows you to explore and practice with different relics/weapons/skills each run, instead of bombarding you with everything all at once. IT IS HARD to put down and MUCH harder to master. As of now I can full clear on base difficulty in 18 minutes tops, but experimenting with the increased difficulties really requires you to have sharpened your skills.

With two people, we beat the game on our second run, sword+bow. As the bow user, I had multiple worlds where I took 0 damage easily. The right freeze build makes all normal mobs pointless and the final boss patterns were way too easy to ranged (always safe on diagonals). I'm looking forward to how the game develops. It plays very fluidly and in a fun, easier version of Hades.\n\nEdit: Revising my review after further gameplay. We beat it before even unlocking some things like the skill combiner and later weapons. I'd say one big downside is that you will lose progress in a run if you disconnect, which has happened in multiplayer where we both black screened.

It has the same metagame. If you like Hades, you'll probably like this too, especially if you love pixel-stylized graphics.\n\nWith that said, there some very jarring issues you need to consider:\n\n> The game is somewhat close to Hades in price, but is about 20% cheaper. Now you'd expect 20% less content AT WORST, or at best, far more content due to how this has NO VOICE ACTING IN THE LEVEL OF HADES, and IT HAS A FAR MORE EASIER TO DESIGN GRAPHICAL STYLE.\n>> But nope, this game is about 50% less in content compared to Hades. The game, before launch, was at 0.11. And then suddenly it was 1.0. Go figure.\n\n> Cheap reliance on difficulty. At 1.0, the game's difficulty was on the easier side, but this was because the controls are SUPER RESPONSIVE and there's no attack commitments. Devs didn't like people beating the whole 1h campaign in less than 1h and cranked up enemy density to roughly 3x or more. They also attack WAY faster.\n>> To add insult to that, the most recent update, as if charge attacks weren't an absolute trash of a mechanic, they made more mechanics revolve more on charge attacks. With now much more enemy density and how fast they attack (this is on normal, mind you), and you have half of the weapons literally losing half their power due to relying on charge attacks. On worlds 3+, charge attacks become IMPOSSIBLE to do. So forget about using hammer.\n>>> A lot of these charge attacks rely on perfect timing. It's not just charging attacks and you'll be good, even skills need to be charged to get their full potential. Their base functions suck if you don't time the releases right or charge them, and this becomes especially important in world 3++.\n\nThese devs decided not just to cut content and then add it later into the game in the guise of a \"free update cos we good guys\" type of scummy BS move, they also do not play their own game and listen to the community re: balance. They just throw enemies at you, cut animation charges of enemies and half, and then called it a day.\n\nDo not support these developers in the future. Even Skul, with it's atrocuious balance as well, fares better than this. Better buy Astral Ascent instead, that one is gorgeous and has very nice balance.", "timestamp_created": 1678255042, "timestamp_updated": 1702497864, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47624930739402771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134260799": {"recommendationid": "134260799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141838189", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 2452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1707088752}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is wonderful and very well put together in every way.\n\nGameplay loop similar to Hades, but with multiplayer!

The production gets it right in practically all aspects and offers, as the icing on the cake, co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. I have yet to test the multiplayer which, by numerous reports, provides a polished and entertainment-rich experience. So I'll stick to single-player in the comments.\n\nFirst, the story is set in the world of Nexus, where the Ember Tree, a tree whose leaves are blue flames, symbolizes balance. However, an evil sorcerer named Praxis threatens tranquility by sucking energy from the plant and it is up to the flaming knights to face him. Simple and effective background, with the presence of additional characters to enhance the plot.\n\nMechanics do not reinvent the wheel. There are hack n' slash and ranged combat, in which the player will choose one of the five available weapons for his run, varying attributes such as HP, damage and critical hits. There are four distinct scenarios, each containing mini-boss, boss and several rooms that are seen linearly, full of enemies, normal or special versions, elite and champion. Their diversity and quantity is good and the game is visually communicative in indicating to the player their movement patterns and attacks, encouraging them to determine their own approaches to combat.\n\nRegarding the strategy, in addition to the initially chosen weapon, there are skills - complementary powers/spells -, relics - passive effects - and gems, which represent upgrades such as speed and spell strength, among the others mentioned above. Sometimes it will be possible to decide between two options before advancing to the next room, for example: increase HP or damage? room to receive a new skill or relic?. That said, adding to the coin management - purchase of items in stores - the flames (ember), used in the tree to acquire permanent upgrades and the presence of special areas and secrets, make Ember Knights a comprehensive title - and there a vast end-game planned for v1.0.\n\nIt wouldn't do any good if the balance was inadequate - although some builds are a little overpowered, the overall balance is good and will only get better given the dev team's attention to feedback. The default difficulty is well tuned and it is possible to significantly increase the challenge using unlockable modifiers after the first victory. In addition, and amazingly given the amount of game facets, it does a great job of presenting all its features: nice, clean and effective user interface.\n\nTechnically, the high quality standard is maintained. The pixel-art is expressive and accompanied by a good soundtrack, even if the sound mix leaves something to be desired regarding music volume variability. Finally, we find a frantic gameplay, very responsive and without excessive buttons.\n\nIn short, Ember Knights is such a cohesive production that the fact of playing it safe as to the execution of its conception is in no way a negative point - it packs the best within the style of the rogue-like genre, adds multiplayer, an extra spice via its setting and closes the set with a dynamic gameplay, generating epic moments like in battles against bosses. Solid established base and promising future. Highly recommended!\n\n- - - [pt-br] - - - \n\nEmber Knights, mesmo em early access (v0.9.1), j\u00e1 \u00e9 um dos melhores rogue-lites dispon\u00edveis no mercado. A produ\u00e7\u00e3o acerta em praticamente todos os aspectos e oferece, como a cereja do bolo, multiplayer co-op para at\u00e9 4 jogadores. Ainda n\u00e3o testei o multijogador o qual, segundo in\u00fameros relatos, fornece uma experi\u00eancia polida e rica em entretenimento. Sendo assim, vou me ater ao single-player nos coment\u00e1rios.\n\nPrimeiramente, a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 ambientada no mundo de Nexus, onde a Ember Tree, \u00e1rvore cujas folhas s\u00e3o chamas azuis, simboliza o equil\u00edbrio. Entretanto, um feiticeiro maligno chamado Praxis amea\u00e7a a tranquilidade ao sugar a energia do vegetal e cabe a cavaleiros flamejantes enfrentarem-no. Plano de fundo simples e eficaz, com presen\u00e7a de personagens adicionais para incrementarem a trama.\n\nA mec\u00e2nica n\u00e3o reinventa a roda. H\u00e1 combate hack n' slash e ranged, no qual o jogador escolher\u00e1 uma das cinco armas dispon\u00edveis para a sua run, variando-se atributos como HP, dano e porcentagem de acertos cr\u00edticos. Existem quatro cen\u00e1rios distintos, cada um contendo mini-boss, boss e diversas salas que s\u00e3o encaradas linearmente, repletas de inimigos, normais ou as vers\u00f5es especiais, elite e champion. A diversidade e quantidade dos mesmos \u00e9 boa e o jogo \u00e9 visualmente comunicativo em indicar ao player seus padr\u00f5es de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e ataques, incentivando que o pr\u00f3prio determine suas abordagens nos combates.\n\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 estrat\u00e9gia, al\u00e9m da arma optada inicialmente, h\u00e1 as habilidades - poderes complementares/magias -, rel\u00edquias - efeitos passivos - e gemas, as quais representam upgrades como velocidade e for\u00e7a de magia, dentre os demais citados anteriormente. Por vezes, ser\u00e1 poss\u00edvel decidir entre duas op\u00e7\u00f5es antes de avan\u00e7ar para a pr\u00f3xima sala, por exemplo: aumentar o HP ou o dano? sala para receber uma nova habilidade ou rel\u00edquia?. Isto posto, somado ao gerenciamento das moedas - compra de itens nas lojas - das chamas (ember), usadas na \u00e1rvore para aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de upgrades permanentes e da presen\u00e7a de \u00e1reas especiais e segredos, tornam Ember Knights um t\u00edtulo abrangente - e h\u00e1 a previs\u00e3o de um vasto end-game para a v1.0.\n\nDe nada adiantaria se o balanceamento fosse inadequado - apesar de algumas builds serem um pouco OP, o equil\u00edbrio geral \u00e9 bom e s\u00f3 tende a melhorar dada a aten\u00e7\u00e3o da equipe de desenvolvimento aos feedbacks. A dificuldade padr\u00e3o \u00e9 bem ajustada e \u00e9 poss\u00edvel aumentar significativamente o desafio utilizando-se de modificadores desbloque\u00e1veis ap\u00f3s a primeira vit\u00f3ria. Al\u00e9m disso e, por incr\u00edvel que pare\u00e7a dada a quantidade de nuances, o jogo faz um \u00f3timo trabalho em apresentar todos os seus recursos: interface de usu\u00e1rio agrad\u00e1vel, limpa e eficaz. \n\nTecnicamente, o alto padr\u00e3o de qualidade \u00e9 mantido. A pixel-art \u00e9 expressiva e acompanhada por boa trilha sonora, ainda que a mixagem de som deixe a desejar em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 variabilidade dos volumes das m\u00fasicas. Por fim, encontramos uma jogabilidade fren\u00e9tica, bastante responsiva e sem bot\u00f5es em excesso.\n\nEm suma, Ember Knights \u00e9 uma produ\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e3o coesa que o fato de jogar seguro quanto \u00e0 execu\u00e7\u00e3o de sua concep\u00e7\u00e3o em hip\u00f3tese alguma \u00e9 um ponto negativo - empacota o que h\u00e1 de mais interessante dentro do estilo do g\u00eanero rogue-like, adiciona multiplayer, um tempero extra via sua ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o e fecha o conjunto com uma gameplay din\u00e2mica, gerando momentos \u00e9picos como nas batalhas contra chef\u00f5es. S\u00f3lida base estabelecida e futuro promissor.

I checked this past week to see where things were at and decided it was close enough. Lol. I couldn't wait anymore.\n\nWhat an absolute treat!!! Played this game for about an hour with the wifey and it was a blast. Then a couple of good friends of ours came on and wanted to play something, so they grabbed this game to try with us. We ended up playing for three more hours. Lol. \n\nMore rogue like games need to have multiplayer fleshed out like this game does. Playing solo is great enough. The combat is smooth, and there so many different ways to kit out your character to keep the gameplay fresh. This fun factor is multiplied when you add friends because you can talk strategy and do some cool team combinations. Everyone can be their own unique character with a unique playstyle, which is so refreshing. We've barely started unlocking weapons/skills, but it's obvious we all will have plenty of unique options to choose from. More ways to play is always a plus.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm 35, but the pixely/Super Nintendo art style was an instant draw. Having the four characters be very distinct, different colors helps with keeping track of yourself in all the chaos. Enemy and boss design/art style is anything but generic. We all have a collective \"WOAH!!!\" when we first saw the boss of the undead world (3rd world i believe?).\n\nI hope this game continues to get much more content and support after it's \"official\" release.

This has found the perfect balance between ramping difficulty between worlds and ramping power of your character. It is incredibly fun with incredibly whimsical and clever character designs. Each character really stands out, even the mobs. I can really tell that a lot of care has been put into each aspect of the game. Even each skill feels very unique and fun (summoning spirits is my favorite). I love finding new synergies between skills and relics.

I wish [spoiler]weapon upgrades[/spoiler] were unlocked earlier, so I could experiment a bit more and maybe keep interest a bit longer before seeing everything in the game. I may have never even played more to unlock them if my friend didn't want to play coop.\n\nThe weapons need some tweaks. The only weapon that felt good to use was the sword. Being locked in weapon animations and unable to dodge does not feel good. I want to like the other weapons, but animation locks/stuck in place make them nigh unplayable. In a fast-paced roguelite like this, every weapon should feel highly mobile and controllable. This might be the change that would improve replayability the most.\n\nFreeze may need a rebalance. The \"Freeze on Perfect Skill\" relic completely trivializes 90% of the game except for bosses. You freeze all mobs then hit them 5-10 times then can freeze them again before they can move. Rinse and repeat. It makes the run overpowered, but in a boring, tedious, damage-sponge way.\n\nCurrent post-game (alla Hades \"heat\") is just raw stat buffs to enemies, which is not interesting at all. It's not interesting enough to me to continue playing much more.\n\nTL;DR - Game is fun, but does not have enough replayability currently to merit $15 pricetag.

Feedback so far based on this stage of early access:\n\nPros: SO MANY\n\nCombat is excellent, the variety of weaponry is good with very different attack styles and benefits between each. The skills you can acquire add to the fun and flair of the game, and the relics (various buffs) can result in some very fun builds. The pixelart is AMAZING! The animators did an incredible job. The combat (OH GOSH THE COMBAT) is absolutely awesome. Because of how different each weapon is, it adds a HUGE amount of replay value. There are actually benefits to dying, which is a REALLY nice touch - you're actively rewarded when you return to the first area after death OR success with additional unlocks. The difficulty is high and requires some fast reflexes, but the developers are more forgiving with damage than some other roguelikes are - you're never gonna get one shotted, and it's not exactly like you can only take five hits before you're out, so you feel like you can still survive despite the huge amount of combat and decently plentiful enemies. The bosses and minibosses are fantastically programmed and difficult, making it very rewarding to defeat each one. I was surprised that it has a decent emphasis on story, with generally fun and eclectic characters and a comparatively intriguing antagonist. There's enough mystery surrounding this figure to where you kinda wanna know \"who or what is he really?\", but it's not necessary for the enjoyment of the game. He pops in at random times in the dungeons, often when you're taking a lot of damage, and it adds some neat tension to the intense combat. \n\nCons:\n\nLike most EA games, it suffers from a lack of content. Though there are 5 weapons already, four areas, probably close to 12-16 different minibosses (4 with what seems like maybe 4 variants apiece, only found a few variants so far), 4 main bosses, and a decently wide variety of unlockables, the game is definitely incomplete. \n\nI would like to see even more base game weapons, with additional kinds being unlockable via a DLC expansion or something later on. Some of the weapons seem unbalanced compared to others - the bow, though weak, is wicked fast and makes it easy to avoid enemies (it's so good its borderline broken), the basic sword has some of the highest damage output as well as the best mobility, but the other three weapons (staff, hammer, and ninja star thing) feel comparatively meh, in my own opinion. The staff has VERY weak basic attack with a charge attack that feels like it takes too long and leaves you too exposed to attack. While the staff hits fast and it's nice that it's meant to boost skill damage, it's really hard to get past even basic enemies in the beginning, especially if you're used to the range the bow has. Due to its emphasis on skill damage, if your skills are recharging, you're kinda stuck with dealing little to no damage with your basic attack. It serves little purpose other than recharging your skills. More skilled players may enjoy this, but I'm not a fan of it personally. The hammer CAN be more powerful than the sword in that it has a wide area of attack and each part of the combo can be charged for extra damage (a nice touch, that), but it suffers from being severely slow in a game where the emphasis on movement is everything. The ninja star thing has some really cool stuff going for it, as it's the single highest crit rate weapon with the potential for the greatest damage output as a result, but it also suffers from less mobility than other weapons. It would be cool to have it maybe maintain PART of the slow mobility, while adding easier dodges or more invincibility frames. OR perhaps a short i-frame dodge where you can dodge mid-attack and the star boomerangs back to you wherever you go. \n\nThe game is fairly short at the moment, but it feels like it's a lot of work just to get to area 4. I would love to see something like Risk of Rain 2, where the next world can be one of 2 or 3 randomized options, each with their own enemies and environmental challenges. \n\nSome of the relics and skills seem very weak, and others are borderline game breaking. For example, if you have a relic that allows you to burn enemies, such as one that makes your first attack burn, then there is another relic that makes it so that enemies get stunned when they're burned. This effectively freezes the enemy in place, removing all resistance from them and making them very easy to dispatch. This relic alone allowed me to beat the game very easily the first time I got it.

If that sounds good, stop reading this review and buy it, you'll have a great time.\n\nEmber Knights is structurally identical to Hades: pick a weapon that defines your run, go through four worlds with riffs on their same bosses and minibosses to build predictability while keeping things fresh, choose between two possible outcomes for the next room, and use the currency you gained during a run to buy swappable upgrades in a number of categories. If you liked that gameplay and progression system, you'll feel right at home here.\n\nEmber Knights' combat is a little slower and more methodical, with more emphasis on charged attacks and commitment and less on dodging, which I definitely appreciate. Character upgrades found during a run depend less on your weapon and instead rely more on your chosen skills and elemental effects, which feels more like I'm making big meaningful decisions during my run instead of determining my all behaviors before I even step out of the gate with my weapon choice.

The gameplay reminds me of the best parts of [i]Hades[/i] and [i]Curse of the Dead Gods[/i], which happen to be two of my favorite games.  Plus the little Ember Knights are adorable.  \n  \nLook, it's difficult to quantify what makes a roguelike good except that they evoke a singular feeling: [i]Just one more game![/i]  Ember Knight starts off right from the beginning giving players a lot of fun toys to use and combinations to play with, if you like the way [i]Dead Cells[/i], [i]Binding of Isaac[/i], and [i]Hades[/i] build up synergies then you'll like Ember Knight's gameplay loop.   \n  \nThe combat itself is rock solid, tight as [i]Mega Man[/i].  I think I might actually hammer my face buttons harder in this game than in anything else in my library.  The special powers have a novel recharge mechanic wherein the player has to get so many strikes with their primary weapon (usually 10-20, depending on the powerup) before you can use your special again; it's a really fun little meta-game within the combat, specials are easy enough to recharge that I don't feel the need to hoard them, but they're spaced out well enough to keep them feeling special.  I like it!  \n  \nPlayers get plenty of weapons and powers to choose from, there is an enhancement track, \"More strength,\" \"Start with 50 gold\" stuff like that.  There are lots of unlocks, I imagine it'll take me a while to get the entire upgrade path done, but on the bright side there are free respecs, so you're not punished for playing around.  \n  \nNo notable Early Access tax!  I think it's a solid game as it is!  That said, I imagine that things like balance and whatnot will change between now and release, but the game as it is has enough content and enough [b]fun[/b] that it's easy to recommend.   \n\nIn more explicit terms: The federal minimum wage is $7.25/hr, I've gotten 6 hours of playtime out of Ember Knights (so far) and I paid $14.99 for it, like, there are some AAA $59.99 titles that only have 6 hours of gameplay.  Haven't run into any bugs, the gameplay is fun, the choices seem robust, if you're looking for a new roguelike to add to your library I think Ember Knights is absolutely worth your time!  \n  \nEdit: Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that you'll die a lot.

About 90 minutes in, I completed my fourth run with a victory and a \"more content coming soon\" screen. I still have skills and relics to unlock, as well as one more weapon, but there doesn't seem to be much left to do content-wise and the game's just too easy for a rogue-lite. With no ascension or similar system to increase the difficulty of runs, I feel no desire to go unlock the rest of the stuff knowing that future runs will all be just as easy and go through the same 4 zones. None of the bosses took me more than one try to figure out, the three deaths I had were when I was just figuring out the controls and getting used to the mechanics, and I just kinda blasted through all of the areas and bosses solo without any close calls or difficult fights really. \n\nThe gameplay feels solid, if rather simplistic, and it does feel fast-paced and fun. The art is very nice, the game is very nice to look at, and the music is pretty decent. I enjoyed it in a casual turn-off-brain kind of way, and for the amount I spent I'd say getting an enjoyable 1.6 hours out of it was good enough to recommend it as an early access title. \n\nI might come back in the future when they add more content, and I *really* hope some of that content includes higher difficulty options and some system to make future runs more difficult after completing your first one.", "timestamp_created": 1672214553, "timestamp_updated": 1672214553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129494202": {"recommendationid": "129494202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061204067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1672209268}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun.

gameplay that I am already very addicted to. And yet until a friend of mine mentioned it, I hadn't seen it in the store or had it recommended to me. I've even scoured Steam for new roguelikes and somehow missed it until now.\n\nWhile not the hardest roguelike I've ever played, the game clearly has a TON of room to grow and will be adding a lot in the future. Ember Knights seems to be a genuine labor of love and I cannot wait to see what else the developer has up their sleeve, as the content already presented in this early access title is top notch. It made me a tiny bit sad to hit the wall on its current offering, but it took me just over ten hours and believe me, I WILL be going back. I was pleasantly surprised to find that after I returned to the over world, yet another opportunity for fresh, interesting gameplay presented itself to me. I poured my entire day into this game, and I STILL haven't seen all it has to offer, even in early access.\n\nI could gush about this game all day.

You will definitely get your money's worth if you like the rouge-like genre at all. \n\nWhat I love:\n- art and animation: very charming and consistent style that makes the game visually appealing\n- combat: the combat is fast paced and feels really good. Ability recharge system is unique and satisfying; rewarding a more aggressive playstyle with more frequent abilities\n- build variety: there are a lot of build choices (skill and relic combinations) that give each weapon multiple play styles. Archetypes have solid synergy between skills and relics that let you really specialize\n- progression: unlocking new skills, relics and features is fun and you're given enough at the start of the game to feel the variety of options you have\n- replay value: replaying levels is fun and each run feels unique\n- difficulty: I tend to prefer games with a higher challenge rating and this game fits the bill\n- cooperative play: playing with friends is a heck of a lot of fun and the \"revive allies on boss kill\" mechanic adds excitement when 1-3 team mates are dead and 1 person is left soloing the boss \n- affordability: the price point is at a reasonable threshold which makes it easy to convince friends to give it a shot\n- timed runs: I love the small benefit you get for completing an area within a certain time limit. It creates an interesting incentive to make fast decisions and play aggressively\n- attention to detail: little secrets are fun to discover and explore\n\nWhat could be better:\n- grouping up: the only way to group with friends is if someone makes a party and invites you directly (you can't use the \"join game\" steam feature) and if you accept the invite while not in the main menu they will have to send it again\n- no way to re-join: right now if a team mate disconnects they have no way to re-join the game \n- bugs: there is at least 1 game breaking bug in which talking to an NPC locked me and a friend in a menu with no way out and we were forced to abandon the run and restart\n- colour options: the characters could have a few more colour options (you can unlock new ones so this might not be a real issue)", "timestamp_created": 1670336500, "timestamp_updated": 1670336500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128015341": {"recommendationid": "128015341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057743948", "num_games_owned": 380, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 517, "last_played": 1696383579}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "joguinho j\u00e1 t\u00e1 bom, quando acabar de lan\u00e7ar as coisas vai ficar melhor ainda", "timestamp_created": 1670298153, "timestamp_updated": 1670298153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127993173": {"recommendationid": "127993173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028046422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1690, "last_played": 1697146952}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!\nIf you're a huge fan of Hades this game is for you!

The items are not complicated, but they interact in so many ways, I almost always end my play through feeling like I found one of the best combos in the game. \n\nVery fun with friends (up to 4 player). In a lot of games, that many players becomes visually confusing. One of my favorite things about this game is that\u2014even with 4 players\u2014you can still manage to tell what is going on. The graphics are fun to look at, but they aren't over the top, meaning the spells and abilities don't take up more visual \"real estate\" than they need to. \n\nLots of replay value with unlockables, recently released new world, and difficulty dial. \n\nIf I had to complain, I'd say the newer content has complicated the game in a way that takes away a bit of the simple charm the game had before they were released (4th world, weapon abilities, difficulty dial). You don't have to adjust the difficulty. You don't even HAVE to buy or use the weapon abilities, but the 4th world stands out significantly. The various enemies are more complicated, yet look more similar to one another. There's a lot more moving parts on the bosses. It is a cool challenge, but I have to admit I kind of liked the small, tidy package it was, and how quickly my brother and I could beat the game and get that quick dopamine hit. \n\nOverall, I love this game.

Which will result in taking damage that doesn't feel like it was player's fault but rather game design / cluttered vfx. \n\nThere is a simple solution for this. Less breakables objects on the levels, slightly bigger rooms and less saturated backgrounds would improve the clarity as the player wouldn't be confined in a tiny corner with 10 monsters, aoe spells and some environmental traps. It's hard to see where my character is aiming with his sword at times. Dodges are direction based so if you don't see where the arrow is pointing you might dodge right into enemy AOE.... Perhaps its easier with a gamepad as you can at least hold the analogue stick in a general direction but with the mouse there is nothing to reference except the arrow that indicates the direction of where player will attack / dodge. If that arrow gets obstructed then it's pretty much SPAM and SEE tactic.... sometimes it works ok other times results in taking damage since player's character was facing the wrong direction. \n\nThere are currently only 4 weapons to choose from and they cannot be equipped until later on ( need to collect enough shards through playing in order to get them unlocked automatically ). There is little in terms of character customisation ( no helmets or armour unlocks, however I haven't played long enough to see everything so maybe later on player's will unlock some of those things ? )\n\nThe difficulty spikes up once more upgrades are unlocked. So instead of breezing through first two zones, players will feel slowed down by elites and minibosses that honestly feel like were designed in CO OP in mind. As a solo player I rarely have a chance to do 1 attack let alone charged up skill. Dodging 10 attacks and eating inevitable AOE damage is not fun. \n\nI do not recommend this game to anyone.

He liked Super Metroid, he liked Dark Souls, he even liked fighting games. It had been years since Nintendo had touched the Metroid franchise. So, he thought to himself, why don't I make one?\n\nIt was 2012. Matt had already been toying around with Flash sidescrollers. Having fun dipping his toes into making stuff, just for fun. Matt was also an excellent artist already; he drew comic book art, in a style similar to those old 80s sci-fi anime's. He didn't really know anything about programming, but after conversations with a mutual, they agreed to partner up and try to make something special. Try and make a Metroid-like that was somber, yet lively, and hauntingly beautiful.\n\nSo a Kickstarter was made. Matt didn't really know anything about making games. Few people outside of the industry really talked about it back then. They did some math, guessed about how long it would take them, and a goal was set - mere $15,000. A measly amount compared to even most indie games of today. It seemed like enough back then. And the Kickstarter was a rousing success, funding waaay above goal. Not quite enough to reach the oft-joked about Wii U stretch, but a windfall nonetheless. The money was divided evenly between the two bright-eyed and idea-filled partners. This was it. It was time to hunker down and get started.\n\nBut then the programmer's work started to slow. He would miss calls, skip out on meetings. He stopped returning messages. Slowly, he himself became a ghost of the project. He had taken the money, but wasn't producing the work. There was so much to do! But only Matt remained. And only Matt would continue the project.\n\nStencyl is a good engine to work with visually, especially if you are new to making games. Although shaken by the silent departure of his once-partner, he soldiered on; dutifully creating all the artwork, pulling from sound libraries and implementing his ideas into the game engine. It was rough going, for a single man. But it was going. And that was all that mattered, with the weight of the fully funded Kickstarter behind him, and the growing coverage of his dark, yet vibrant take on the (for the time) neglected genre.\n\nHowever, Stencyl just couldn't keep up with Matt. Fixing bugs was a struggle for this new developer. And the more content and artwork and ideas he shoveled into the engine, the longer and longer it would take to compile, sometimes up to 45 minutes for each change! Instead of smoothly moving forward, working on the game was becoming frustrating. This couldn't go on. A change had to be made.\n\nSo Matt makes the tough decision to switch engines, communicating this to all the Kickstarter backers. It is an understandable, if regrettable choice. The game was already at least halfway done! But it was also necessary. The engine was pushed as far as it could go, and Matt, burning the candle at both ends to make his dream a reality, had no choice but to start over.\n\nThe next years are spent learning to code. Unity has plugins to work visually, like Stencyl. But so much MORE could be done by directly coding it. Ideas exploded forth. The animations could now be expanded upon. Even more options for including melee and different weapons were now a possibility. Matt hadn't stopped playing other games during these years, and they all helped to shape and grow this new vision of Ghost Song.\n\nA vision I hope you will enjoy in its completion as much as I have.\n\nThanks for reading.\n", "timestamp_created": 1668069329, "timestamp_updated": 1668069329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431954622268676758", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125195477": {"recommendationid": "125195477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059318066", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1981, "last_played": 1691385058}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so Fire and it's not even finished yet.

[h3]I rate Hades a 9/10[/h3][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]The reason I downvoted this (which I plan to change afterward if there is a change, I love it) is because the game has a clear bias towards the Staff weapon, the game should be named Ember Mages or Ember Wizards instead of Ember Knights.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]You have 4 weapons available to unlock in-game but playing it enough times you will realize real quick the clear favoritism towards the Staff. I will explain why, the game is design with 4 inputs: 1 attack, 1 roll and 2 skills then you get passive items called Relics which buff you like in [u]Risk of Rain 2[/u] (chance based, trigger on enemy kills, trigger on 3rd attack).[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]The game also has a perfect cast function on Skills when you hold and release at the right time like the perfect shot in [u]Curse of the dead gods[/u] or bow in [u]Hades[/u]. Perfect Skills usually deal more damage. Some relics trigger their effects on Perfect Skill. Skill cooldown is also based on hits you do on foes, for example hit foes 10 times to cooldown your Fire Skill.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Now the Staff is the fastest of all the weapons in-game (click-attack) and this is just its base form, Staff becomes even more scarier when you unlock weapon modifications (fastest charge attack). Relics like poison, burn, lightning, etc. can easily cater the Staff. There are relics that crit/apply poison on first hit, lightning on crits, poison/burn foes on roll, etc. All of these Relics, Skills and Stat Gems can easily be used with more efficiency on a Staff.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 You want to cooldown your Skills faster? Use a Staff. \n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Perfect skills dealing even more damage? Use a Staff, get skill weapon mod, skill relics and skill gems.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Poison build with the Bow? Staff can do it better.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Crit build with the Bow? Staff can do it better. \n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Drop money on Crit? Staff can get crit relics.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Drop money on killed poisoned foes? Staff can get poison skills and relics.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Heal on perfect cast and defeated frozen foes? Staff can do it.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Lightning crit build with the Hammer? Staff can do it better.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Crit and burn build with the Sword? Staff can do the same, get crit and burn area relics.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Stunlock foes with the Hammer? Permastun with Staff on burn-stun relics and burn skills.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Always Crit on frozen foes? Use the Staff mod that charges your attack faster to always crit on a massive cone AoE.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 You wanna farm Ash fast for weapon mods? Do a Staff run. All the fastest speedrun within top 5 is a Staff, check it out on the Speedrun website. The Hammer and Bow have a hard time getting inside top 8.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 All the best weapon mods that synergize well? Staff.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Even Gem Stat upgrades can easily buff the Staff, crit gem gives only 4% crit chance while you can easily get 20% skill damage for spells. \n\n\ud83d\udfe1 You can also stack crit chance with Staff since it has the fastest attack speed plus there are crit relics like +25% crit chance on burned foes and +25 crit chance on poisoned foes just get burn/poison skills and relics and your Staff can get 50% above crit chance.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]The one weapon that comes close with the Staff is the Sword but even the Sword has CONS with its weapon mods like LOSE the Burning effect on your Sword if you drop down 75% HP or LOSE the damage buff you gained on killed foes if you get hit. Guess what? On the Staff there are NO CONS, you don't lose anything, you gain everything. While Hammer/Bow shares a goofy ahh weapon mod that only applies SLOW on foes.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]You think Staff being a spellcaster like Gandalf, has support weapon modifications? There are NO support weapon mods at all. Just dealing damage and nukes.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Staff is Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli combined. \nStaff is the perfect spellcaster, damage dealer and crit assassin. \nSupport-teammates weapon mods like SLOW are given to the Bow and Hammer instead.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n    \u2b55 [i]SS tier:[/i] Staff\n    \u2b55 [i]S tier:[/i] Sword\n    \u2b55 [i]A tier:[/i] Hammer/Bow\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]You remove all 3 weapons (Sword, Bow and Hammer), keep the Staff and the game would still be crazy good since you can do almost everything on it. With the Staff being the fastest weapon, you'd think the weapon mod: faster charge attacks would be given to an actual charging weapon like the Hammer, NOPE still given to the Staff. The most underwhelming weapon mods are the Hammer and Bow. Staff can do a spellcaster or attack-proc build.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udca0Suggestions:[/h1]\n\ud83d\udca7Lock Ashes farm on weapon choice, for example you can only unlock Bow weapon mods if you do a Bow run, you cannot unlock Bow weapon mods if you do a Staff run. I farmed all my Ashes by doing Staff runs since they are the fastest (about half the time it needs for the hammer and bow). This incentivizes people to actually use Bow and Hammer.\n\n\ud83d\udca7Staff mod [u]FOCUS[/u] that gives +15% faster charge attacks should be given to the Hammer. The Hammer is a charge weapon, +15% faster charge attacks to synergize with Hammer mods' [u]CHARGE ENGINE[/u] and [u]FISSURE[/u]. Or +15% attackspeed to synergize with [u]BATTLE RHYTHM[/u].\n\n\ud83d\udca7Hammer mod [u]CRUSH[/u] that slows should be given to the Staff's charge attack instead since it is long range. Foes here DO NOT run away from you, they go to you to attack, why would you give a slow debuff on a melee weapon that makes you a tank? \n\n\ud83d\udca7Hammer mod [u]CRUSH[/u] change it to maybe apply a debuff on foes so your Hammer's charged attacks can deal more damage on them (opposite of Hammer mod [u]DEFIANCE[/u]). Since you are charging your attacks to [b]\"crush\"[/b] your foes.\n\n\ud83d\udca7Hammer mod [u]FISSURE[/u] should also activate [u]BATTLE RHYTHM[/u] for synergy.\n\n\ud83d\udca7Bow mod [u]SLOW ARROWS[/u] change it to [u]POISON ARROWS[/u]. Bow is a medieval fantasy ranger weapon. They harness poison from plants and poisonous frogs/snakes. Since Sword has burn. Maybe Hammer should get a chance to cast lightning? Staff heal teammates? \n\n\ud83d\udca7Bow mod [u]POISON ARROWS[/u] + [u]BOMB ARROWS[/u] = Leaves a poison mist on the area after the explosion.\n\n\ud83d\udca7Bow mod [u]QUICKNESS[/u] change the +15% movement speed (you can get it with Agility gems) to 15% DODGE chance unique only to the Bow.\n\n\ud83d\udca7Hammer mod [u]SMITE[/u] maybe add an additional effect like 25% chance to cast lightning? Smite from the gods.\n\n\ud83d\udca7Replace 2 weapon mods of the Staff with an actual support function: +1 HEAL for you/allies? BLIND foes? Damage REDUCTION? \n\n\ud83d\udca7Give good mods on both Bow and Hammer, they are charging weapons.\n\n\ud83d\udfe6PROS:\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Couch co-op up to 4 players, can play online (go to discord).[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Minimalist HUD, you can turn OFF Enemy HP bars, Damage Numbers, Pop Up Texts, Pulsing Red Dying Foes, etc. In Hades you cannot turn off Enemy HP bars.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Cool relic builds like Poison, Fire, Lightning, Heal, Crit, etc. you can build them great.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Weapon mods, you can apply 3 modifications for each weapon.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]4 worlds available and there are more updates coming.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\ud83d\udfe7CONS:\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Everything can be done on the Staff.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Skill/Spell-heavy early game for new players.

The gradations in difficulty between \"Normal\" and \"Doom\" give you more ember (meta currency), but there aren't specific rewards for each new difficulty cleared BEFORE you reach Doom.

It's actually very fun, but it differs a lot from other roguelites. There is not much that changes in between runs. You get a currency called ember, which can be used on minor to major upgrades (+10 health, +1 revive, etc.). In addition to that, you can find up to six skills (after the first miniboss/boss of each area) and a lot of relics. Once you've beaten the third boss of the last area, you can modify weapons to alter the playstyle of the weapons. For example, each weapon has three slots with three choices each. The staff comes equipped with the modification \"additional skill selection\" (3 choices of skills instead of 2). Once you've unlocked Marvin (weapon mod guy) you can switch this to \"cast a seeking orb after every skill\" and one other option I can't remember. Lastly, you'll eventually unlock the shop for the starting area, which will presumably take ember and give you a bonus for the next run (I think I need one more run to unlock it, so I'm not positive).\n\nAs far as the weapons go, there is four choices (though they look like they will add more). The sword is fairly basic and what you would imagine: swing, a rolling strike, third strike has additional crit chance. The bow has limited range (not the whole screen) with a charged shot that has a longer range, and the third shot shoots twice in quick succession. The hammer slows enemies and attacks slower than the sword. It also has a different charge attack each time. The staff is my favorite, but it's definitely weird. The basic attack only deals 3 damage (compared to 10 for the other weapons). But if you charge it, it attacks rapidly and finishes off with a strong strike. The staff gives +25% skill damage. The staff is meant for a skill run.\n\nSo, as far as skills go, one of the first rooms (2nd or 3rd I think) you encounter in every run will offer you one of two skills (3 with the staff). The skills do a variety of different things, such as a cone of fire, magic missiles, a line of ice, a ballista, etc. You will unlock new skills with the tablets mentioned above. In addition to skills, you will get a relic (2nd or 3rd room) which can make some devastating combos with your skills. For example, you can get the cone of fire skill and combine it with a relic that summons a wisp (temporary companion) when you kill a burning enemy. There are a few other relics that combo with fire.

But I also have no idea how to do that better\n-some descriptions are confusing (e.g. one relic applies 'chain lightning', which doesnt count towards 'lightning' of another relic \n\nTLDR: Great action-focused game. If you like games with a challenge, the possibility to try out different builds and where most of the playtime is combat-action than give it a shot!\n\nI can't wait for the game to be finished and try out the coming weapons. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1663765385, "timestamp_updated": 1663765385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

The game has been through just a few builds since I've been playing it but I can tell the devs are actively working and trying things out, and the changes are welcomed and interesting throughout. Definitely a good game to keep an eye on and come back to often.\n\nMultiplayer feels great. I'd appreciate more accessible lobby management, allowing adding / removing players in the hub world would be nicer than having to break the lobby and make a new one whenever a change is needed.\n\nThe difficulty scaling might need tweaking (it felt like, in earlier builds, multiplayer was just a bit too difficult for a \"default difficulty\".

I'm happy to say it is extremely responsive, and at no point in time did I take any hits in ~5 hours of gameplay that I didn't deserve from reacting too slow or ending my dodge in a bad place (after invincible frames). \n\nThere are several different weapons you can take on each run and they do change up the gameplay pretty well. \n\nI have not played multi-player yet, but was able to finish all of the currently available levels solo.", "timestamp_created": 1662057965, "timestamp_updated": 1662057965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121556077": {"recommendationid": "121556077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144599774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 548, "last_played": 1706714225}, "language": "english", "review": "Still in early access but it's pretty fun.

If you have played Hades, Enter the Gungeon, or Undermine, then you'll immediately feel right at home here.  This game is fun, challenging, well designed, and is a great choice for both newbies and veterans of the genre.  I don't think it's as good as the games it's influenced by, but it's still very much worth your time.\n\nWhat's Good:\n-This game looks fantastic visually!  There are lots of bright colors, especially shades of blue, purple, and orange.  There are three main stages, and each one has a unique theme and specific color choices.  All of the attack animations, spells, and bosses look awesome visually.\n-The meta progression is top notch, and feels like a mix of Enter the Gungeon and Rogue Legacy 2.  You will need to complete different goals which gives you access to blueprints which will then start to show up in future runs as new spells or powerups.  You can also purchase upgrades which will make you permanently stronger for future runs.\n-This game is fairly challenging and offers a high skill ceiling.  I think it finds a really good balance for both roguelight fanatics and newbies to the genre.  I've played for about 9 hrs, and I still haven't beaten the boss of level 3.  This is the final boss as of now, and is quite challenging, although beatable w/ enough practice.\n-Ember Knights has a really fast, fluid, and well designed movement system.  This is a fast paced game that plays out like a hack n' slash.  Similar to Hades, the movement system has to be top notch in order for this to be a game that keeps player's interest.  \n\nCould Use Some Changes:\n-This game could use some alternative bosses, at least one additional level/biome, more build variety, more enemy diversity, and some overall balancing.  Right now, when it comes to Stat Upgrades, you should always take Damage over everything else.  It's way more beneficial than any other upgrade.  These are things that I expect the devs to iron out before the 1.0 release.\n-I would love for the devs to take a few more risks.  Most of the runs play out very similar to each other.  I haven't had one single overpowered run and there aren't that many interesting synergies.  You don't really pick up a ton of upgrades, making it very unlikely to get an OP run.  This game feels more like Hades than Binding of Isaac w/ regards to balancing, build variety, and synergies, but I still think it would be nice if the devs added a few more interesting upgrades that really spice up runs.\n\nConsensus:\n-Solid Game (Tier 2 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  Ember Knights has a ton of potential, but even if not much is added before the 1.0 release, this is still a really fun, well rounded, and well designed action roguelight.

The room sizes don't change, and it becomes a cluster of colors that you try to navigate. Good luck seeing ANYTHING red on the ground when you have 2+ people.\n-The relics are absolute trash, literally useless.. Handful are actually good, but rare to get.. The ones you do get you'd rather not ever take. \n-Boss fights are meh, hit box reg is pretty bad. Not to mention anything that AOE's or drops puddles becomes a landmine. Especially during multiplayer.. Seriously, make the room bigger.. You can hardly run yet alone breath with how small they are for 3+ players.\n-Stats are pretty much useless.. No matter what path you take in stats, you play the game the same from start to finish. Always never feeling powerful enough, but just lucky enough to survive. Sounds like fun, until you realize that it's fake difficulty.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing with my friends, but the current state of the game is not worth $15 USD.. It should be free to play with the state it's in. It's enjoyable for realistically about an hour or 2 before it's the same relics/stats and deaths.

Or I can  give myself a 4% chance to do 50% more damage by taking crit - an effective 2% increase in damage.  Like, I know everyone is not the best at math, but how an entire team of developers think that having RNG damage is somehow *ten times* more costly than consistent damage is beyond me.  \n\nHow people handle crits is usually a good indicator of how they can grasp statistical balancing of damage overall.  Noob players like big crit numbers, and usually crit is not the right call when you break it down, but Ember Knights misses the balancing mark by such a laughably wide margin that I had zero confidence in their ability to design systems when I first noticed this.\n\nAfter playing for several more hours, this was reaffirmed.  All of the level up choices are bad except for damage.  I don't know in what universe 12% max HP is valued as much as 20% damage, but they seem to think so.  Maybe move speed is hard to rate, like most utility powers, but nothing even comes close to damage in terms of value.  This is largely true of anything balance-wise that involves numbers..  They massively overrate any alternate source of damage in terms of cost - poisoning an enemy does an absolutely pathetic amount of damage; all of the DOTs are a total joke.  There is precisely one viable build path for stats - damage, then damage, then more damage.  \n\nThere is a good game here somewhere.  The controls are pretty tight.  There are some iffy boss attacks that can be impossible to avoid, but it's rare, and a few other gripes, but solid overall.   The unlock system is a little grindy and restrictive in choices, but nothing egregious.  I would normally think that simple numbers balance is an easy fix... but this is just so far off that I don't have real confidence in their capacity to correct anything.\n\nNormally, I would advise game developers who make these kinds of mistakes to take a statistics course or something to get a better grasp of how these behind-the-scenes numbers really work.  These guys probably need to take a couple remedial grade school math courses before they should consider putting any numbers at all into actual game code.  I could throw darts at random numbers to determine stats and do a far better job than Ember Knights.\n\nAs is, a mediocre game at best.  Fix the outrageous balance issues and it might be above average for the genre.  They probably aren't going to do this (assuming they are even capable, which is far from guaranteed), so as it stands this is a solid thumbs down from me.", "timestamp_created": 1660590031, "timestamp_updated": 1660590799, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428007900714874268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120683419": {"recommendationid": "120683419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873848236", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1710994447}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always wanted to play Hades in a Multiplayer format...

Might help to play w/ others to speed up the process.\n\nThe recent weapon customization update is an amazing feature that lets you personalize your weapons pre-game, but take awhile to unlock. Expect those choices ~20 hrs in if you're a solo player. These may help patch some of the weapon's weaknesses as currently only 2 of 4 feel particularly strong, though that may just be me. Once you get these all unlocked each weapon has 3 choices of 3 passive slots. EX:[spoiler] Spread shot on Bow & Leap attack on Hammer are game changers!

all of the bosses are fun to fight, and the mini bosses keep you on your toes, with a system in place so that their move sets are randomized accordingly, the fact that this system even exists kind of just proves that this game has quality.\nThis is one of those games that's simply better with friends, it's centralized to an extent with teamwork in mind, not to say it's impossible to win by yourself, but it's much easier to have someone watching your back, as well as essentially just making your dps greater due to how many people are dealing damage at the same time.\nThe way the ember tree works, is essentially a perk deck, which is flexible and can do pretty much whatever you want, whether that be re-rolling skills, or having regeneration upon a room clear for example, this makes it an interesting experience in the sense that this influences your play style, as well as having the relic shop in the beginning of the game, this allows you to have a lot of control of how the run goes.\nThat all being said, i think i should talk about the synergy between items, the fact that so many items can play into each other is just fun, and then there's some items that require perfect casts to use which essentially just rewards you for playing well even further, as well as all of the items being beneficial in one way or another, there is no item that will screw you over, realistically it's just your own lack of skill or consistency that gets you killed.\nPersonally i have no gripes with this game, the fact that it's so well made and only 3 months old as well is

The bow, hammer, and staff do have their own perks and stats, but compared to the sword, it's down right low tier. The sword(or the ember blade) has a 50 hp and 25 chance to crit on the 3rd attack, which is pretty with it's low stat crit of 2% (which that's a problem i get to later) and have the same damage as the hammer. I'm not saying nerf sword, but rather buff the other weapons, because the bow is okay but still feels weak even though it has a high crit chance and speed, it be better if yall gave it more crit damage( about 250%, 100% more than sword) to counter balance the lower damage the bow has, and booted crit stat of 10%, with it's speed being 130% or a least 125%, every thing else don't change. Now for the staff i recommend a buff in the spell stat of at least 150% or 175%, instead of having a skill stat of 125%, and give the staff a -20% off on skill cooldowns or give him 3 skills to use instead of 2, but the cooldown one is better in my opinion, also, give him some crit chance of 3% tto make him a more balance to the sword. The newest weapon addition hammer is pretty lackluster, it dose have higher hp than sword but thats it, with the added bonus of pulling, slowing and stunning enemies on each hit, it might sound good but with that being it, it kinda sucks, with it having a lower speed due to the heaviness of the hammer, which dose make sense and is expected, but it has the same damage as sword and having no crit, it's safe to say it sucks, but it doesn't have to suck, maybe giving it more damage(about a stat of a least 20) will make sense, if the damage is balance right i would be fine with no crit, but to make it fair, give the hammer a crit of 2% or 1% at least, if this is done it will be a well like weapon for people who want bash some heads in. Now as much i talk about the sword i think sense the other weapons are getting buff, the sword has to be more well rounded too, so make the sword have a crit chance of 5% and crit damage of 130% or 125%, to make a more well rounded weapon, also keep the perk of the 25% crit on 3rd hit. if the weapons were more like this i know that it it will be more enjoyed.\n\nRelics and Shops:\nThe relics are pretty good, though i think the reason why everybody who plays this thinks that the relics are so meh is because of how much these relics occur and used in players game play,  a player will only have 5-3 relics at world 3, if there lucky enough to afford stuff from shops and maybe get an item off an enemy, In my and some other players opinion that's pretty low, especially for the difficulty of the game(which i have no problem of) and the lackluster items too. To fix this maybe make the shop occur more, about 2 times per world instead of 1 or 2 times(if you lucky to get one in ??? rooms), also make the shops have more choices, like 4-6 choices for items 2 for potions and heath, and another section that 4 choices for stat increases, the shop doesn't have to have such limited options for stuff, i'm not saying to make the shop a  creative mode with all relics and stat increases no, just make it have more options and spaces for at least 4 Players to each get an relic or stat increase.\n\nSkill tree:\nI do love a skill tree in games, everybody does, but i really really think it will be better if some not all change be use at the same time, like the relic dice, skill dice, stat dice, all being used once you unlock them, the same goes for most of them except the revives, but even then the lease on life and the soul shelter should stack on to each by first reviving with the lease on life until the last reviving which is the soul shelter, also quick crit-tic, soul shelter and maybe lease of life should have a thing of if you defeat a mini or world boss you get 1+ revive in the counter, i think that would really be fair and fun to the players. Back on what i was talking about, i really do think it wound be way better if you can use all the skills in the ember tree if you unlock them, to make it hard but more learning for the new players and more rewarding to unlock every thing in the skill tree.\n\nTimid chest and Boss stat increases:\nif their one crit-tic i have, i really do hate the timed chest, why wound yall add this, 90% like to go at their own pace, even then the time is so low that it's practically a speed run to the boss, i can the time be increased to a fair point or just let the chest be open for defeating the boss, also after the boss can their be a shop there just for convenience. Also can yall please give each player play a stat boost for defeat a boss, no one want to fight over who get's stat boost because the boss only drops one, no matter how many players are playing, same goes for the timed chest.\n\nI like the game it fun, but it just a little bit meh, if yall can listen out an try to at least do one of this i swear this will be a better and funner game for all players. thank you", "timestamp_created": 1658090743, "timestamp_updated": 1662137029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610502839088439941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118963726": {"recommendationid": "118963726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334879077", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 957, "last_played": 1700608967}, "language": "english", "review": "do the thing, buy it and enjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1658073053, "timestamp_updated": 1658073053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118947412": {"recommendationid": "118947412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047009428", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 12314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 191, "playtime_at_review": 1314, "last_played": 1713687099}, "language": "english", "review": "Pure adrenaline-filled fun solo and with friends, surprisingly variety of builds and playstyles,\nbut definitely be ready to take on a challenge toward mastery.", "timestamp_created": 1658048354, "timestamp_updated": 1659757190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118937531": {"recommendationid": "118937531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970241049", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1688268571}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fun and with the multiple weapons and abilities it doesn't get boring at all", "timestamp_created": 1658029355, "timestamp_updated": 1658029355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118932227": {"recommendationid": "118932227", "author": {"steamid": "76561199109178987", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1658019534}, "language": "english", "review": "skill bullding game that takes a fair amount of skill with a little bit of luck.", "timestamp_created": 1658019681, "timestamp_updated": 1658019681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118930636": {"recommendationid": "118930636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094506956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1672214127}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing is really balanced in this game other than the sword class, and considering not everyone wants to play melee, its a very poorly balanced game in general.\n\nDodging still allows you to be hit during the animation.

The various types of mini-bosses are cool, but the final bosses per world stay the same with the same attack patterns.

But alas, I must so I will give a few Critiques, some positive and some negative.\nSword Class: Probably my favorite class in the game because of the crit chance on the third swing and it feels really rewarding to beat someone up without relying on skills, although give the sword class the knights charge ability and the enemy's will be in for a rude awakening. My only gripe with this class is ironically the crit chance, I feel like if any class needs love in this game its the archer class which I will get into a bit later. The sword class for some reason has more crit chance than the archer class, although in concession the archer has more base crit chance but only by 3 percent so that is negated by the fact that the sword class has 25 percent on his third swing. So my critique is more in lines of the archer class.\nArcher Class: This is probably without a doubt the worst class in the game even after recieving a buff in this patch. He just has little going for him/her unfortunately. My biggest concern is that his arrows simply can miss because they have travel time unlike the mages attacks. I feel like the fix is simple, either implement a relic in the game that makes his arrows track (which would be awesome to see class specific relics) or give him tracking arrows already in his kit, make the arrows seek out the enemy. Other critique for this character is that his base health makes no sense because of how weak he truly is, the man has 30 base health, most enemies in this game have dashes or dash attacks at you, so arguing the fact that he has range doesn't work because one the melee enemies in this game will just dash at you and two the other enemies have ranged attacks negating his \"range advantage\". So the fix would be simple as well increase his base health a little bit like maybe 35 or even 40 like the mage and increase his crit chance to 10 even 15 percent. \nMage Class: This class imo is by far, bar none, the most overpowered class in the game once you get good with the spacing of the character. This classes attacks simply do not miss and the fact that when you do the charge attack for this character and it charges your skills faster then any class in this game is beyond broken. Top this with the fact that they get a selection between 3 skills (other classes get a choice between 2) makes it able for them to not waste time in other skill rooms. There is no critique for me for this class, most powerful class just not the most fun IMO. (if you get the crown relic they do become the most fun admittedly, the crown relic in this game allows you to stack skill dmg infinitely) \nHammer Class: This class is hard to play. Most rewarding class in the game dare I say. My biggest gripe with this class is that if you do not get the third charge attack on your hammer swing you get super punished. Another gripe is that you can't dodge mid attack if you are not using the charge attacks on this character. This character is really fun but is also superrrrrr slow, which feels so bad, like I get the whole aesthetic of him carrying a hammer makes him slow but if that's the case his base dmg should be a lot higher than the other classes. So here is my fix for him, lower his max hp to 55 and raise his dmg up a bit more. Also I love the idea of the slow affect but maybe make it a rupture affect like make the enemies maybe wobble when they move towards you because they did just get hit by a big hammer or just improve the slow affect because it might as well not be on the character imo, because you yourself are already slow with that class. \nOverall: A phenomenal game, I love the relic; I love discovering the secrets like putting fire on apples makes apple pie.(which is hiliarious btw) I love the new update and I really love how charming the character design. I will not be crituquing the game itself because it is in early access but I love the game play either way right now. of course it lacks depth and options with the characters late game, but I know that in due time their will be more.  For example the skill tablet lizard lady becomes literally useless late game but that is okay haha, ik there will be more content so overall great game!

The combat feels smooth and the dodging / attacking is very forgiving, so you won't have many moments where you feel like you lost unfairly. \n\nMy main complaint is that it's too short. I've already beat the game and it took me abut 8-10 hours. (It says 3 cuz I imported the save from another device). That said, I don't think this is because it's too easy. The game is certainly easier than other rogue lites especially once you get the upgrades rolling, but my first complete was only 22 minutes, and I didnt have a particularly broken build either. Once they add the 4th world, that should help, but a 5th world w a long final boss fight is what this game really needs to bring it up to standard w games like enter the gungeon where you can put 100 hours in without beating the game.\n\nLastly, the weapons seem really unbalanced. Maybe everything but the sword is meant to cater to CO-OP and buffing the other weapons would throw off the balance too much, but as it stands, the sword is by far the best for solo. The worst part about that, though, is how long it takes to clear w every other weapon. The game isn't even finished and my FAILED bow runs sometimes take 30 minutes. IMO, they have no business advertising 4 weapons when only 2 are usable for solo, and the sword is the only one that's actually fun. \n\nAlso, add matchmaking please.", "timestamp_created":

Pretty much everything about it I enjoy. The art style, the feel of combat, the unique builds you can make; I find new fun relic and skill builds every time I play, the boss fights are well designed, even the sound is great. And hey, maybe this isn't the game for you, but I would definitely recommend this game to anyone & everyone to at least give it a chance. So far I have been very impressed, especially being an early access game at the time of this review (also, the content releases/updates are not too infrequent, and have substantial additions if that matters to you). The only thing that's not amazing if I had to pick something, is that the villain isn't particularly unique or threatening, but that's okay because that's not really what this game is for anyway. I've had tons of fun both playing solo, trying to set new run times for myself, and also just messing around with friends; the game is great for both.\nTLDR: Fun gameplay, tons of unique builds, fluid combat, generally good design, good for solo and co-op play, not super story heavy but there is at least one there.

(1 Poison Stack on hit on the first enemy per room, who needs that? And who thought it would be a cool idea?)\n - The skills are so unbalanced, that you can basically tell whether to remake or not after clearing the first few rooms and getting your first skill and relic (first skill and relic aren't even a choice, the game just throws something at you). If they are shit you can restart immediately. Which means a lot of runs are already dead even before they really have begun.\n - Lots of meta progression, even for some core mechanics. Rerolls for example are meta progression.\n - Sadly game also tries to avoid that you have fun with friends. While the game has multiplayer, it doesn't integrate it in a cool way. Some thoughts:\n     - It's not possible that every character uses it's own meta progression upgrades. So the host counts. So everyone has to play with the host build.\n     - Progress is not shared. If your friends play alone after playing hours with the host, they have 0 progress and start from scratch.\n     - Why are relic/skill choices locked to players? Why? Why can't you just show a choice of relics and each player can pick what he wants? I had many situations where another player wanted one of my choices (which were all crap for me). But I had to take a crappy choice and my mate then also only got crappy choices(for him), but which in turn would have been good for me. If choices weren't locked to players, there would be way more fun communation and build testing.\n     - The more players the harder it gets the play the game.

Music is good, sound is good, visuals are beautiful! Bad guys are tough. \n\nLove this game! \n\nMy only two criticisms are\n#1 MOST of the legendary relics should be a lot more \"legendary\". They're all pretty underwhelming and they don't come up often. When they do, no one in my party takes any of them. The regular and rare relics are much more potent and worth taking.\n\n#2 The perks from the ember tree could be tweaked a little bit, specifically the reroll factor on relics/skills/stats. If you reroll your relics or skills or stats, you shouldn't be able to be presented the same items you just rerolled. It doesnt happen often, but it does happen and that should be adjusted. \n\nOther than those two, very minor things my friends and I have really enjoyed playing through this game, beating it... and then continuing to play as the continuing release of content keeps the game fresh and interesting.

This game has a lot to offer in terms of mechanics: perfect timings, damage fall-off over the distance and different [i]meaningful[/i] status effects just as example. To add the praise to acknowledgment - a very few \"skills\" (aka your second and third attack you can pick freely durring the run) and enemies are ussing these, so devs just need to mix them up into new entities (or be as generous and leave them unique, lol). The game has complete and strudy framework on par with completed projects. Devs just need to add more flavor and gametime at this point.\n\nOh, about the game itself, sure. It's your \"skill-based rogue-lite\", not a heavy RPG\\top-down hybrid like Heroes of Hammerwatch I was expecting from promotional materials. You need to run around and execute everything on site and yourself. Pre-planning is the weakest part and you have literally 2 picks before the run: permanent upgrades at the tree and your weapon.\n\nThis game is very casual-friendly, as well. You have optional aim-assists (both enabled by default, so BE A MAN and disable them, ya git), auto pick-ups, silenced traps on room clearing and many things you would consider \"modern\". But it can also offer a challenge to more scrupulous public after a little bit of a grind (the third level is designed to kill you at least once right now, and you have to clear it to get an access to difficulty switch; of course it's a hard-lock, because total of 5 levels is planned, but, maybe, devs would revise this sooner than the release date). There are other details filling onto that EASY-part, like a constant eerie feeling that elite mobs were just regular ones at earlier stages of development, but I'll keep those humble speculations to myself.\n\nI could have spoiled a lot of things in this review, but you should probably try it yourself - all the good sides are perfectly visible within 2 hours of refund window (and even the game itself is beatable for some within this time, so you could rate the replayability yourself).", "timestamp_created": 1654612914, "timestamp_updated": 1654613384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430608659982681274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116628241": {"recommendationid": "116628241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055646348", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1656502969}, "language": "english", "review": "The entire presentation of this game is top notch. Lovely, detailed, spritework and everything \"gels\" together very well.\n\nI also dig the fast-paced combat, feels very fluid and responsive, even with kb+mouse. Basically a top-down shooter with a 3/4 view and fantasy theme.\n\nThat being said, i am not sure if i like the overall (Level) progression mechanics. Now i am not familiar with rogue-likes AT ALL, but in this game you basically have a series of randomized rooms with progressing \"biomes\"; Essentially like a classic level-based game you have to do in one, perfect, run (Forest World -> Ice World -> Whatever Area 3 is). \n\nWhich, as a challenge, is absolutely fine. But it also means you constantly see the same scenery untill you progress further into any given run. And i'll be honest, after an hour i was sick of that bloody forest. Give me more of that amazing spritework to look at!\n\nI know this is tricky to implement with the current idea behind (Level) progression, but the way it is now it becomes quite samey and dull eventually and makes me not really wanna bother to improve.\n\nNow this also might just be me, but i feel that could be a turnoff for more people.\n\nOh, and i also ran into my personal sprite pet peeve here; The main characters sprite is mirrored, resulting in the sword switching hands when turning around. But, hey, that's really nitpick territory. ;)\n\nOverall though, this looks and plays fantastic, which is why i recommend it. \nGive me more of that amazing spritework to gawk at, more variety during runs, don't mirror your sprites and i'm all for this. ^^\n\nEdit (About a year later): It still lacks variety and they still mirror their sprites.

Combat is fun and intuitive, mobs are very different, areas are very distinct. I love that bosses have different versions of each other. The secrets are great and have actual repeatable gameplay usage, so knowledge helps a lot! \nLight spoilers ahead!\n\nFeedback:\nShop:\n- In our playthroughs, we always had too much gold on our hands. We finished a run with one of us having 999 gold and the other one 500. Maybe more options in shops?\n- In 99% of cases we were disappointed by a skill choice instead of a relic choice in shop. We always purchased stat increase and relics, sometimes potions and pretty much never skills\n- Falling into the same problem: anything besides flat starting gold felt pointless, even though the other ones were more tactical/late-game orientied, they didnt really work out at all because of too much gold\nGameplay:\n- We felt like the sword is the best option by far. Bow seems underwhelming and staff is too reliant on good skills. The only reason why sword had a downside was very melee-heavy attack patterns of bosses\n- 2x Hailstone armor OP, makes everything besides bosses a breeze\n- enemies tend to do a 180\u00b0 flip of aggro in the last frame of attack-animation. Sometimes we got nuked by a forlorn in the last split second because the aggro/attack area changed all of a sudden. I feel like frame-wise the game acts up a weird way sometimes. Forlorn attacks feel awkward overall\n- Freezing enemies on the last frame of attack leads to some awkward interactions. The forlorn's lasers and the vanguard's charge acted up weirdly in conjunction with freeze.\n- the boss right before the last one (some of its forms: mischief, beguile etc.) felt super tough as sword/melee. We felt like it was harder than the actual main boss because again, a lot of his attacks were really awkward to dodge as melee\n- some stat options felt underwhelming. We didn't feel an impact of movement speed as dodging should be the main choice of travel/well... dodging, also it feels awkward to have varying movement speed throughout runs. Skill damage felt underwhelming most of the time. Flat dmg, HP and crit dmg (with relics) felt like the obvious choice most of the time\nGeneral: \n- There are a lot of sound bugs\n\nLooking forward to additional updates!", "timestamp_created": 1654513174, "timestamp_updated": 1654513174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116569021": {"recommendationid": "116569021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038872572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1330, "last_played": 1697376386}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game , fluid movements. really can't wait for more contents to be released", "timestamp_created": 1654511920, "timestamp_updated": 1654511920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116566098": {"recommendationid": "116566098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060667862", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1699704505}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, very enjoyable especially with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1654505780, "timestamp_updated": 1654505780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116565586": {"recommendationid": "116565586", "author": {"steamid": "76561199204903648", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1654576415}, "language": "english", "review": "crazy herald so crazy", "timestamp_created": 1654504534, "timestamp_updated": 1654504534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116520092": {"recommendationid": "116520092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110932668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1655, "last_played": 1690717361}, "language": "english", "review": "really nice fast pace rogue lite", "timestamp_created": 1654429862, "timestamp_updated": 1654429862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116498098": {"recommendationid": "116498098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005356923", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 7017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1710821523}, "language": "english", "review": "is good.", "timestamp_created": 1654388002, "timestamp_updated": 1654388002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116497889": {"recommendationid": "116497889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248869710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1707701315}, "language": "english", "review": "nice, good game.", "timestamp_created": 1654387513, "timestamp_updated": 1654387513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116491157": {"recommendationid": "116491157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298292895", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 799, "last_played": 1704611068}, "language": "english", "review": "YO THIS GAME IS FIRE LOWKEY ON A STACK.

There is a tiny amount of time after your dodge that you will remain invulnerable.\n+The enemies in each area look great and they are all unique to that area. There are no recycled enemies from area to area and you can really see the thought and effort the devs put in to the art direction and enemy variety.\n+There are quite a few skills and relics and they are all fun to use and allow for you try to various builds, some more effective than others but I think there are probably at least a few builds you could get through the game with.\n+This game is challenging but fair, you always feel like you want to give it just one more try.\n\n\u263aCONS\u263a\n\n-Although this game does tell you it plays better on controller, it would be nice if they could get the mouse and keyboard controls feeling better. They feel pretty cluncky compared to the controller. For some reason the commands don't feel as responsive.\n-If you have the ballista ability or wisp abilities, the enemies that charge forward in the ice area can appear to be locked on to your ballista and then they can switch to targeting you at the last possible millisecond and you can get hit by their charge.

I'm in the midwest while my friend is in the south east, yet we didn't feel any major issues in combat, just a bit of desync after combat when drops were spawning. We sat and played for a bit over 5 hours in one go. Something that I wish was implemented was a note explaining what Perfect Skill casts are(just hold the cast and release when the lines match up). Because we didn't know this, we pretty much avoided relics with this condition. We assumed that it was like a crit, with a low chance of occurring. \n\nOne other thing we were hoping for was getting to pick our color of ember knight, but it is sadly tied to player number.\n\nSome other thing would include stuff like rebalances to the starting weapons, more weapon options, and more synergetic skills and relics, which is all things that will probably be looked into in the early access. At the moment, there seems to be a single skill(at least that I know of) that actually applies a burn effect, so all the relics that have to deal with burn aren't even useful unless this skill comes out.\n\nThings to note about the online multiplayer though, the game saves and uses the host's save file, so progress is made on the host's file and not on the people joined.\n\nEdit: After some more playtime, we have come across more fire based relics.

Another problem i have with the game is that they recently added a new weapon but the thing is that this weapon imo sucks... The charge up factor of the weapon is useless pretty much because if you keep charging than you will just keep getting hit especially in the ice area. Another this is the Relecs leveling system is useless because 9 times out of 10 you are getting different relics or the one you got is just not very good... The highest level i got was 3 at the final boss and it still was not any better really. The final problem i have with the game is that the stat selector is kinda trash... If you choose the damage stat it will give you 3 damage and that is not very good and the crit chance stat gives you like 4% crit which in theory is not bad but the starting crit chance for the sword is only 2%!?! That is not very fun. In other games like Dead cells or enter the gungeon is that you are constantly getting more stuff and getting better and in this game it feels like that does not happen.

Not a healer class mind you because that could potentially break the balance of the game, But maybe a shield class that can take damage for their allies or give damage/defense buffs.\n\nWe also need new enemies/worlds. While the 3 worlds that are in the game at the moment are very good and have a lot of care and attention that was put into them, We need new ones because the 3 worlds feel like they are only half of the package.\n\nOverall this is an amazing game and I would easily recommend it to any one.

If you've ever played Risk of Rain 2, and enjoyed it, then this is a must-have. The combat is very fluent in this game, and very strategic, as all the enemies you fight have unique aspects (excluding elites), and as a result, different strategies. Loot is distributed at the end of a level, giving either a Skill, one of 2 you can have in a hotbar, or a Relic, a permenant buff that can be situational or very useful. As of now, you can choose of two classes; Sword or Bow, which are pretty self explanatory. The roguelite element in this game comes from Ember. In a run, you collect Ember, which, when your run ends, you can use it and previously collected Ember to grant yourself a permanent bonus while in battle.

(the attacking frequency is the same, you dont have to mash faster than in hades, luckily)\n\nwhat i did not like, was the low weapon variety, and overall small-feeling choice of upgrades. there are currently 2 weapons available, a sword and a bow, and the devs have announced 2 more mysterious weapons. the (two) weapons feel very distinct, but, well, 2 is just 2. there is a good amount of different spells and temporary bonuses (temporary as in: active for the rest of the current run), but those do not actually mix up the gameplay substantially in my opinion.\n\nthe short run to the (mini-)boss is nice from the perspective where you can smash your head against them until you git gud enough, but on the other hand, the levels all look pretty similar, with a nice but relatively small enemy variety. this makes them easy to run through and enjoyable in the sense that they perfectly accommodate the fighting.\nthe meta-progression is also not very substantial - until you unlock revives. you can unlock max. 2 revives (i think that's the current max.), and they do help a lot. the other bonuses seem a lot like those from hades, so nothing game-breaking, but certainly nice to have.\n\neverything else that could be said is just more of 'this game also has x, which is very similar to hades'. it does not have any substantial story though, which, aside from the art style, is the only major difference to hades, in my opinion.\n\naside from the many similarities, why did i not like it then? the much smaller weapon variety, compared to hades which already did not have a lot, is not great, but not the main deal-breaker for me. i do not like this game for the same reason i did not like hades: it is pretty much on the 'like' side of rogue-like/lite, so you will run through early-game areas A LOT, with very similar combat-capabilities. this feels super repetitive, somewhat exaggerated in this game where you can beat each room in under a minute, and enemies deal an absurd amount of damage. the combat is also really fast paced, with no blocking capabilities and a dodge that is not quite as forgiving as i would like, in boss-fights (dodging works great against regular enemies). this means you have to run around constantly, evading projectiles coming from every area on the screen at once (at times) and AOE's appearing beneath you, while attacking wildly in essentially every direction. it is too damn hectic for my liking, and with no redeeming qualities (art direction is very nice, in this game and in hades, but that alone does not make me want to play them), this game is a pass for me.", "timestamp_created": 1653087492, "timestamp_updated": 1653087492, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115748699": {"recommendationid": "115748699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198950760273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1656111429}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is Simple and Challenging so it's a pretty fun game to play", "timestamp_created": 1653074130, "timestamp_updated": 1653074130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115747897": {"recommendationid": "115747897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205714391", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1708209264}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing co-op Rougelike fun!!!", "timestamp_created": 1653073253, "timestamp_updated": 1653073253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115735893": {"recommendationid": "115735893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069847652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1673578380}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with a lot of promise!

The game is still great, but just like Hades, it feels like you're repeatedly playing the same thing. The only things that change are which rooms gives you what loot, whether it be gold, skills, relics, or stats. There is a very small amount of maps, so you'll be going across the same level layouts repeatedly. It gets very tedious to get back up to the thing that killed me, as if I continue to die, I have to start all over. It honestly worked better as a roguelike rather than a roguelite.

I was able to complete the game's content in about 5 hours, but I'm sure there are some that could do it faster, depending on skill level. For $15 this seems like a great game for the amount of content.\n\nThe combat is really fluid, and getting the timing of the enemies is super important as it allows you to navigate the sometimes frantic fights. You can dodge around, and depending on your timing you can avoid enemy attacks. Dodging is super important in this game. There are several encounters that last about 15-60 seconds before each of the mini and main bosses. There was plenty of enemy variety and new patterns to learn in each of the new stages (or biomes). The mini-bosses even had several variations, which was a very welcome surprise! It can get really hectic and messy at later levels.\n\nAs for the roguelite aspect, it seems like most of the skills are useful in some way, but there are a few I generally avoided. I think that it could be expanded on, but as I was playing it didn't hinder my experience at all. You can upgrade stats and skills, collect gold for shops, and collect relics as you progress through each run. There is meta-progression as well.  \n\nAs of now there are two weapons, sword and bow. Others in the discussion board said that archer was overpowered, but I really didn't feel that way. After I learned enemy patterns, it really wasn't hard to go hack-n-slash mode, and the melee combat felt very fluid. Enemies were stunned after consecutive hits which made it easier on the melee mode. I actually preferred melee to ranged. \n\nI played a couple of multiplayer matches, and it seemed super smooth. No issues at all. Certain enemies do have dash attacks that will change at the last second depending on who is in range, so that could be frustrating, but once I was aware of it, I was able to just dodge anyways to be safe. I still think it should be fixed, though, for clarity and no cheap deaths.\n\nEDIT: There are now 2 more weapons, a Staff and a Hammer.  The staff plays differently, more of a spell-casting influenced build, but haven't tried the hammer yet.\n\nEDIT 2:   I will say that I haven't come back to it in a while, mostly because I feel like the mechanics and feel of the game are great, but literally the only thing lacking is the content. I need to jump back in for the newest boss, but I think that most people could get through it fairly quickly?

Even though combat is quite limited, the good controls alone make up for this.\n\n-Fair Difficulty:\nThe game gets progressively harder and begins introducing smarter, more well-rounded enemies which require a bit more finesse to defeat, making for a satisfying experience. Some enemies are capable of ending your run in a matter of moments, but attacks are well telegraphed and there's a fair room for human error in avoiding damage. Well thought out difficulty overall.\n\n-Items and skills keep gameplay fresh:\nThe items and skills in Ember Knights feel very satisfying to use because they often aren't just flat upgrades to your character, and force you to adapt new and unique playstyles to accommodate for them.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCons:\n\n-Repetition:\nMany enemies feel repetitive, and the variance of Elite enemies and Mini Bosses don't keep the game fresh enough in my opinion. The bosses have very repetitive attack patterns, the mini bosses and 1st boss in particular are the worst offenders. Having some variance to these fights will keep them fresh for players of all skill levels.\n\n-Content Lite:\nGame is Early Access at the time of writing, but feels content lacking at the time of writing. 3 Levels, all beatable within a few hours if you're good. Enemies don't have a lot of variety and the same can be said with weapons.

Why not have multi stage bosses? or why not have it randomly pick 1-3 unique bosses? look at most other games in this genre the bosses are random from a pool of potential bosses, look at enter the gungeon, look at binding of issac, look at neon abyss, all have this mechanic, its a mainstay of the genre. The ONLY sticking point to this game that you dont find in this genre often is multiplayer. Hitbox detection and collisions are poor. feels like you end up with the same builds over and over and if you're playing 4 players you're definitely going to have at least 2 people with the same build. Path selection is almost non existent, and the choices are always straight forward. \n\nAnother issue i had was how the enemies target in multiplayer. The knight that dashes in stage 2, specifically In multiplayer.

Every other option is typically a better choice as it is. \nAllow for Cursor Customization (size/colour). In area 2, I swing/shoot wildly many times because it's hard to find the cursor in the colour scheme and chaos. \nMany times we've restarted as soon as we see the selection of spells that randomly dropped. For example, I really don't care for the bomb, so if I'm doing a run and that drops at the start, I would rather restart than play with it.\nI think there should be more fire buffs or spells. Perhaps consider Chakram a fire spell since there aren't that many relics or skills for fire. Perhaps some more for poison ones too.

I had a great time with it. I finished the last boss available in early access on my 29th run after 20 hrs of play time. I am not a super talented gamer by any means but I do play a lot of games and have beaten similar games like Hades, and Deadsouls.  \n\nThings done well : \n+The hit boxes are super accurate in this game and you never feel like you got hit by something you shouldn't have. \n+The dodge mechanic feels really good, super responsive, and it has a short amount of invulnerability frames to help you dodge through attacks  that would have otherwise hit you. There is a tiny amount of time after your dodge that you will remain invulnerable. \n+The enemies in each area look great and they are all unique to that area. There are no recycled enemies from area to area and you can really see the thought and effort the devs put in to the art direction and enemy variety.\n+There are quite a few skills and relics and they are all fun to use and allow for you try to various builds, some more effective than others but I think there are probably at least a few builds you could get through the game with. \n+The controls on xbox controller feel pretty good and intuitive. \n+This game is challenging but fair, you always feel like you want to give it just one more try. \n\nThe Negatives\n-Although this game does tell you it plays better on controller, it would be nice if they could get the mouse and keyboard controls feeling better. They feel pretty janky compared to the controller. For some reason the commands don't feel as responsive. \n-If you have the ballista ability or wisp abilities, the enemies that charge forward in the ice area can appear to be locked on to your ballista and then they can switch to targeting you at the last possible millisecond and you can get hit by their charge. It feels pretty unfair because you can't really dodge it. \n-You cannot exit the game if you are in the middle of a run! You'll lose all your progress. I don't understand why such a simple game can't start you back up where you left off if you close your game. Runs can take 20-40 minutes and its heart breaking to lose your progress if you have to stop playing abruptly. \n-The sword weapon is just a little bit under-powered compared to the bow. Even though it does higher damage and you have higher health, it doesn't make up for the range and move speed of the bow. Maybe allow the sword to have some innate damage resistance or some other buff. \n\nOverall this was well worth the money spent.

Sound cues from the sound effects are important for reaction times in these games, so I'm not going to \"just turn the sound off,\" and when all you hear is *CLINK CLINK CLINK* from a few coins in a corner somewhere it's extremely difficult to hear anything else.

Maxed out Hades a while back and this has been scratching that same itch. Some suggestions:\n\n- Story is weak, and there is relatively little to do in the \"home base\". Guessing this will be more fleshed out as the game exits early access. Big shoes to fill here, standing in the shadow of Hades. \n\n- No equivalent of Hades gods' elemental effects on your weapon. This was a huge part of the fun for me in that game. What's provided so far pales in comparison to the intricate comboing & minmaxing in Hades. Perhaps there's an opportunity to do something radically different here to help the game stand on its own, such as ephemeral skill trees.\n\n- Sword good, bow bad. Hades was fun because each weapon was balanced. Currently the game is too spammy/frenetic for the bow to be useful, especially towards the end of the 2nd area. Having pixel graphics does not help here (not that I expect the devs to change this; I love the art direction). When more weapons are eventually added, please give us some choices Hades did not. \n\n- Ember Tree has bad UI. Took me way too long to figure out that ONLY the single equipped buffs affect your playthrough. This whole thing needs to be redone.\n\n- Forcing the player to simply wait x number of kills before earning the next relic orb is weak gameplay design. Perhaps there's an opportunity for resource crafting here?\n\n- Rooms have far too few branch points. Some rooms have no bonus either. Hades knew how to do this right, by offering something (even if it was shit) in every next room, and offering many exits per room. This is a small fix that offers the player so much more agency in the game.\n\n- Standard rooms go very quick, and boss rooms are comparatively very long.

I can safely say that this is a really good game. While in this genre offers nothing new to the table, nailing roguelite is tougher than it seems, especially making it fun for each run. Plus the addition of parameter adjustment like the enemy like HP size, Spawn count, and Attack Damage is a nice bonus for more \"seasoned\" player. They nail the gameplay loop with each run is not too long or too short, and plenty of upgrades along the way and few \"special room\" to spice things up. \n\nTo me the highlight is definitely the build variety. Be it a DoT focused build, Crit dps focused build or immortal crit build, this game has plenty of build you can mismatch and use alongside your preferred weapons. Currently his game has 5 weapons, and each weapon has its own upgrade tree that can unlock another layer of mechanics.\n\nThis game becomes a lot more fun with friends, it is definitely the preferred way to play as it is in my opinion one of the better \"party\" game. You can just pop in, play few runs while drinking/chatting and you'd be satisfied. It never tries to be a \"hardcore\" or \"sweaty\" game, but also don't feel too easy which is a good thing. \nOne thing to note, playing with 4 players can be a little too hectic, especially in the smaller room and if you tune up the enemy spawn to 200%. \n\nHonestly one thing that's not really a stood out for me is the music and gameplay sfx. Music wise, I can barely remember anything, while gameplay sfx like hitting with sword etc feels unsatisfying and lack of impact. It is not bad by any means, just it could use a little more oomph.\n\nAlso, so far the developer seems to be updating the game quite frequently, which is really nice to see. \n\nTL;DR:\nPros:\n-Solid gameplay loop, with plenty of weapon varieties, each with their own combos and build.\n-Solid boss battles, which definitely challenging enough without being unfair.\n-Awesome build variety.\n-Awesome \"party\"/multiplayer game to play with friends\n-very polished\n\nCons:\n-The music is rather generic/uninspiring\n-The SFX could use a little more impact\n-Not as complex as other roguelike/lite\n-4 players session can be a little too hectic on the screen", "timestamp_created": 1651828111, "timestamp_updated": 1677156484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115026709": {"recommendationid": "115026709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015943378", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1651610971}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing for 4 Hours and managed to get through it by now, I can't wait for more!\n", "timestamp_created": 1651823903, "timestamp_updated": 1651823903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115020259": {"recommendationid": "115020259", "author": {"steamid": "76561199167131248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 408, "last_played": 1703249084}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Mecanicas simples y jugabilidad que toca la nostalgia para gente que haya podido jugar en la super nintendo.\nprogresion buena en mejoras de estadisticas y variedad de habilidades.\nPor el momento en early access ya pude vencer a todos los jefes y me costo 5 horas aproximadamente...solo falta esperar a que este completo el juego y de vuelta a seguir dandole con todo.\nTotalmente recomendable y por el momento esta de oferta ...", "timestamp_created": 1651809647, "timestamp_updated": 1651809647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115019545": {"recommendationid": "115019545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060707083", "num_games_owned": 752, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 488, "last_played": 1651808004}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging enough to enjoy for the early access content that is here so far.

This is a kind of game that hasn't really had many good titles. Wizard of Legend was very good, but offline coop only - to play online you had to do some weird screen sharing to a friend. \n\nEmber Knights is a high quality game, with somewhat limited content as of this review. The game feels good to play, mechanically. A lot of games don't get this right but Ember Knights nails it. \n\nFor content the game currently the game has 3 acts/stages, 2 main weapons, 12 abilities, and 62 relics. 3 main bosses, and 3 mid bosses, each with 4 variations. The production quality of the different sprites and animations is very high for its genre, and are fairly serviceable gameplay wise, though elites and similar enemy types can be hard to distinguish.\n\nAside from more content and general polish, I'd love to see some more options like high visibility cursors, lower particle effects, or other things to increase visibility. Overall the game is in a pretty decent state already, and I'm excited to see where it goes, because it's on track to be one of the best games in its genres (Roguelite and coop independently).", "timestamp_created": 1651542610, "timestamp_updated": 1651542673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114851188": {"recommendationid": "114851188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131063146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1713129958}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best early access", "timestamp_created": 1651522442, "timestamp_updated": 1651522442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114848873": {"recommendationid": "114848873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263913544", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1689969719}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun rogue lite with really satisfying combat and its even better with friends", "timestamp_created": 1651518865, "timestamp_updated": 1651518865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114848733": {"recommendationid": "114848733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166935890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1692809332}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game all around very little bugs and its brand new.

It has a little tolerance timer on when you can continue the attack sequence to get the combo finisher.

I'm having fun with it, and can't wait to see more.\n\nIt is a bit easier than a lot of other roguelites I've played. This should be obvious by me having only 3 hours in the game so far. But I believe this is because the current three biomes aren't supposed to be the entire game, seeing as it's an early access title. Devs have already given a name for the upcoming fourth biome, and I get the feeling that's not the end of it, either. In terms of difficulty - to draw comparison to a popular game so the most people can get an idea - I'd put this game's third biome at around the level of Hades' second biome.\n\nIt also feels rather incomplete at the moment. The hub area doesn't have a lot of interesting things going on. There's two major NPCs to speak with, each presenting their own primary function to support you, as well as two weapons. The devs have stated that a third weapon is coming soon, though.\n\nBut the difficulty ramp is reasonable as it stands and the gameplay is rather solid for a brand new early access title.

For a roguelite there's a decent amount of content but at the same time it feels like there isn't enough variety. I hope they can fix that with updates. If that is something that bothers you then you'd probably want to wait until the full release of the game.\n\nNow, the actual game itself is a visual treat. The pixel art is honestly amazing and the animations feel perfect. It makes the gameplay look great and combat feel snappy. I'm not the greatest when it comes to these sorts of action games but with Ember Knights I had no problem timing my attacks and dodging with okay timing. Each run you get to pick between a sword or a bow. Both feel great to use. There's a nice bit of building variety but your chances to make a build synergize on a run seem kinda low. Even then after the first 2 hours or so of playing I was able to hit the third map (last one?) fairly consistently (about 10 minutes per map) but every time I got there the miniboss of the place slaughtered me. In a way the game got a bit too easy but then I'd hit a wall with that boss because in particular he had one bullshit ability that I was too slow to dodge that dealt 20 damage when you usually have about 60 max health and limited ability to heal mid boss. That's where the lack of variety started getting to me. Doing the same two maps to get to the third got somewhat stale.\n\nAt the end of the day it's an early access roguelite.

coop funciona de maravilla, no hay lag alguno,y me sorprendi\u00f3 mucho que haya tanto lore y animaciones tan elaboradas en la etapa early del juego (se nota much\u00edsimo el cari\u00f1o y dedicaci\u00f3n en el juego), algo que me sorprendi\u00f3 bastante es el tema del arco, que se implement\u00f3 super bien dentro de una jugabilidad tan fren\u00e9tica, al principio me cost\u00f3 adaptarme pero cuando le agarr\u00e9 la mano pude apreciar bien el por qu\u00e9 de cada cosa, se nota que las cosas en el juego est\u00e1n muy bien pensadas, no dejan nada al azar (o nada que vi hasta el momento)\n\nUn tema importante a arreglar es el tema de recibir da\u00f1o, ya que uno no se entera cuando es golpeado, no hay ning\u00fan indicativo m\u00e1s que el numero del da\u00f1o recibido que es peque\u00f1o y desaparece r\u00e1pido, no hay un knockback, no hay un indicativo en pantalla que recibiste da\u00f1o, no hay ning\u00fan sonido y lo peor es que cuando tienes poca vida no pasa nada, la pantalla est\u00e1 igual cuando tenes toda la vida que cuando te estas por morir y es algo a arreglar porque me di cuenta que tenia poca vida al ver mis stats.\n\nFuera de estos detalles (que se entiende porque es un early) es un juego espectacular, muy entretenido, no es para nada aburrido, una jugabilidad envidiable, si quieres saber si vale la pena: si te gustan los rogue like este juego te va a encantar (la maravilla de jugabilidad recuerda un poco a Enter the Gungeon y Wizard of Leyend, para que se entienda la incre\u00edble jugabilidad que tiene)", "timestamp_created":

Honestly a really fun co-op / solo rouge-lite. They've added a substantial amount of content, not limited to but including: weapons, skills, relics and colors. There is quite a substantial amount of content since my original review on release. Am very content with the content progress and current gameplay\n\nA good little rogue-lite game. Its fun, i like the art and play style. Combat for the MOST part is pretty smooth. Worth 13-15 bucks for sure. Especially if the developers continue to add content\n\nAfter playing solo and co-op some of my thoughts are:\n \nPros:\n>fun easy to digest game with online coop\n>Progression is straightforward\n>Art is nice, music and soundscape are solid. \n>combat isn't easy but not overbearingly hard either\n\nMost of my cons come from co-op, these include\n>Only host is able to earn ember - essentially no progression is shared. including orbs and skill tablets. \n>When bosses drop skill buffs only 1 drops.\n>Gold from destroyable items isn't shared properly\n>Reviving is difficult should revive after mini-bosses or some other option\n>Cant choose ember tree buffs, can only use the hosts. Should be able to use the ones from your own game as well. \n>Not a LOT of content but a good couple hours of plays worth (early access stuff).\n>Latency\n\nAll in all in still having fun. My only gripes came from co-op for the most part. It just makes the experience less cohesive and not as enjoyable. Especially for players who want to play online without private lobbies. \nOnly game breaking bug i've encountered is on the 2nd world, i rolled through a wall and clipped outside the map. \ni could not roll back in but could still be attacked (thankfully). \n\nLooking forward to the future progression from this game, it could really turn out to be a banger.", "timestamp_created": 1650749935, "timestamp_updated": 1702103673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114360696": {"recommendationid": "114360696", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995464792", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1656080137}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game so far.

I totally suggest picking it up, and can recommend co-op with one caviat mentioned below. \n\nAt this point I've completed all relevant unlocks in 7.8 hours. Dev says it should take 10 for a good player and more for someone less experienced. So my experience roughly lines up with that. Despite having all current unlocks though, I don't intend to stop playing yet. I'm still having a blast co oping the game with my wife, and I look forward to playing future updates with her as well. Easily worth the 15 bucks it's at now, and the value will only go up. \n\nMy only complaint about this game is that in co-op, only the host unlocks stuff. This is fine if you intend to only play co op, but I like to play solo too. The game also boasts the ability to join lobbies with random people, and it would feel bad to not keep any of that progress. I'm sure they will sort this out as we get closer to the final build, but in the mean time the best work around is to have your friend who is hosting the game send you their save file. You can copy and paste it into your game files, turn off steam sync by right clicking on the game in your library and going to properties, booting up the game, turning steam sync back on, and then closing the game. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning that they have a roadmap up too that lays out their plans, and it looks like the full game should be out within a year or so.

Hope that eventually they get new weapons/classes. I gameplay is great and easily replayable even after you clear the game completely. Co-op plays really well, and who ever is the host is where in the storyline you are so you can not progress self story unless you are the host and they can not join your game with their unlocks.\n\nCo-op does have a small bug. If you are the host and die, some rooms that the other enters will stutter causing some map objects to either duplicate or be removed completely. So hopefully your best player is the host or you can get some really weird runs with shops having a stack of items or the enterence to the boss room not having food/gold. (Not a major problem).\n\nOnly complaint, is that players must be near the host if they want to upgrade base skills, reveal relics or unlock new skills.

This game wants you to attack the enemies. Of course, if you take a second to observe what they do, you'll have an easier time. Or you can adjust on the fly as enemies have clear tells on when they are about to attack. Just watch out for a possible double attack. \n\nThe meta progression has multiple paths to choose, and while you can only have one perk active in each category there is plenty to unlock and mix and match with to see what works best for you.

The official release date is April 20th, 2022. Now that the embargo is lifted I am able to talk about my experience. Let\u2019s get into this. \n\nEmber Knights Story:\n\nAn evil force has stolen the ember from the great tree also talking about the creatures around it. What will they do with the ember power, we have no clue at the moment. But, there is still hope as Esper has summoned you the Ember Knight to retrieve the Embers and stabilize the lands. As you go through the tear you will face off against the evil forces of Praxis who is our main villain in this story.\n\nThat pretty much sums up what you need to do and of course, your first weapon of choice is a sword. I mean, who doesn\u2019t like a good sword to thwart evil? Now, it is time to jump through the tear and see what danger awaits you. \n\nGameplay:\n\nWith your Ember Blade, you go through and head into Scoggfirth which I consider the grasslands of the area. As you progress you will face off against an assortment of enemies all doing different combat attacks. This is my solo run, but you can fight with three other knights in cooperative play which is great. As cute as this game is, it is pretty tough. Let\u2019s get this out the way right now, you will fail a lot and have to start from the beginning. However, the stages seem to change on each restart. You do keep relics, embers, and other skills you have unlocked, but you lose items and drops you obtained during your journey. \n\nYou will have to master timed attacks for example using the Ember Blade is more than just swiping around like a maniac. You can dodge roll into a lounge attack. Then when you unlock an ability that locks to Y and B. These will have cooldown effects that will cause devastating damage if used correctly. The power will reset once you start attacking enemies again. Some will have numbers indicating how many hits it will take to recharge. Between 10 to 20 and will have an amount you can use said move. So, think on your feet and use your abilities well as you will be swarmed by many enemies.\n\nThe occasional fork in the road is a nice touch. Do you need more Embers or do you need to replenish your health? The choice will always be yours but think because that next area could be a mini-boss and each time you die the mini-boss changes its abilities. Again, the game that is full of surprises is a lot of fun, because think about it! You going into a mini-boss fight thinking it will be the same outcome, but oh snap something is different. Now you just have to switch up your tactics. Or weapon when I finally unlocked a new toy, that made me go, \u201cOoooh what this do?\u201d It was a bow and of course, I have potato aim when using it. However, it is versatile with a combo burst of shots after your first two shots.  \n\nAfter the main boss fight, you venture off into a new area and unlock more relics which can unlock other abilities to enhance your stats as well. There is a nice RPG element to this game that I enjoy and even the countless times I have been defeated I just kept going. The toxic trait I have as a gamer is having tunnel vision and getting frustrated, which Ember Knights will give you that feeling. However, you will have the means to know what to do as you combat each enemy. At least until you get into a new area and then have to figure it all out. But that is the challenge of it, but I will talk more about that in another area. \n\nVisuals:\n\nEmber Knight offers an A-symmetric viewpoint with a tight space as you go through the levels. This game doesn\u2019t offer a jump button per se, but you can use your dodge ability to leap over games in the level. That is a fun feature to have, especially when you want to get away from an enemy since they can\u2019t do that. \n\nSound design is another factor that I am glad the developers took into consideration that brings everything to life full circle. The weapon clashes, monster sounds, and of course the music brings everything together to give fellow ember knights a fun experience. \n\nThe Bad:\n\nThis is not really that bad, but it would be nice to have a checkpoint after you defeat a world. I was not expecting to jump all the way back to the beginning, but you are restoring the tree and talking to Esper, but let me jump back to the world I just died in. But again that is just my own personal feelings towards that small thing.  Also had an issue where sometimes health items will just disappear before I can grab them. For example, I will go to grab the health as soon as it pops up but then disappears. \n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nEmber Knights bring in a fun new style to the Rogue-Lite genre with massive replay value. Helps you learn how to tackle each enemy differently and able to upgrade your abilities to deal more damage. Again I can see how the team-up element can work with this game, but hopefully, I can check out the co-op with some other players with both local and only 4-player co-op. It keeps you moving while also thinking on your feet and even though it is fast action you have enough breathing room to rethink things. \n\nEmber Knights get 4.5 out of 5 paws. Thanks for checking out the review and if you do plan to pick this up, we can fight Praxis together. - Beast Out -", "timestamp_created": 1650458520, "timestamp_updated": 1650458520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497045397758483887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114171685": {"recommendationid": "114171685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837771792", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1651244542}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Ember Knights was a huge surprise for me who never really loved or tried rogue-lites.
