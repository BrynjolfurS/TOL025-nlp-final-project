I used to play video games all the time when I was younger, but prior to my partner getting me a steam deck last year I hadn\u2019t played games in 11 years.\n\nWell one day I watched an older upload of Jacksepticeye playing through Bloodborne, was completely enamored by it and had never seen a game quite like that. So on my deck I had already been playing Doom 2016 and the older Doom titles that I grew up with. And I looked up From Software.\n\nI had no idea what I was getting into, I bought Elden Ring on a whim and I absolutely love all the souls games now. This game affected my life in a positive way. It challenged me, pushed me, hell I went in blind and got stomped! I had no idea what I was doing for the first 120 hrs! There are so many mechanics that now I\u2019m still learning how to be more efficient and effective with my character and weapon builds. The story and lore are awesome and I am excited to see what everyones experiences are in the DLC coming up!\n\nWhile I know these games aren\u2019t for everyone, if you are curious I would give it a go. You will die, you will learn and you will become better!

Lore is weird especially if you're trying to understand it through your play through. Bosses in this game are repetitive af, lots of copy paste mini bosses, but there are some cool main ones. Don't get me wrong I loves souls games but where I personally found this games fails is through pvp, I guess coming from ds3 pontiff shi**er invasions my opinion may be too harsh on the game but I really think there's a lot that needs to be done with the current state of the pvp aspect, starting with invasions. To put it simple they are very unbalanced and all odds are usually against the invader, from getting bad spawns, immediately getting ganked and spammed to getting taunter tongue cancelled as soon as you join another world with the host and 2 other phantoms and worst of all never getting a teammate. Maybe somewhere to start would be make a game with 2 phantoms automatically open the doors to allowing 2 invaders at once without taunters.. Additionally, the network on pc for this game is absolute trash, im not 100% sure its because of the anti-cheat but it really doesn't help pvp at all, you should expect to get phantom hits from a mile away and also expect to see other players in arena floating around, I have good internet and have not had any issues on any other games including the previous souls games. I have a few different characters ranging between lvls 125 to 200 and its safe to say that ive only seen the same thing across all of them in regards to invasions at least. Over leveled phantoms and the game encouraging players to spam, especially wizards lol. I don't really have much else to say but I hope at least some changes are made to the online aspect in the future lol.", "timestamp_created": 1713949513, "timestamp_updated": 1713949513, "voted_up":

All the quirks etc. \r\n\r\nIt may seem like resin but playing this game with a seemless co-op mod has made me fall in love with it again. Having a friend who is also really into souls and has a similar flavor of autism makes this game so much more approachable. Being able to feed off of each others excitement and making more of a solid plan of where were gonna go and what were gonna do is very nice. Other times ive played Elden Ring i just get caught in looting random camps and exploring stuff thats basically set dressing.\r\n\r\noverall this game is daunting if you are a souls try hard that wants to do every last thing.

The open world makes it easy to go around bosses or go level up and come back. That, combined with the ability to summon help for every boss fight, makes it the easiest Souls game by far. The bosses are a little different from other Souls games; a lot of the bosses have long-delayed attacks, and most of them have some form of ranged/grab attacks or AOE attacks. Bosses in past Souls games would have 1 or 2 of these, but it seems like most bosses have all 3 in Elden Ring. On my first playthrough, I played with a mage character and used Terra-Magica and Azure Comet to cheese most bosses. After I beat the game, I felt like the bosses weren't very engaging, so I went back and tried out a strength build. On my second playthrough, I used a great sword with the lion's claw ash of war. It was basically the same story; I was able to destroy most bosses on my first or second try. All in all, I would say it's everything I would hope for in an open-world souls game. I just wish the boss fights were a little better imo.

"language": "english", "review": "There is a solid foundation and a lot of potential, but the multiplayer aspect has been completely scuffed.\n\nReading past interviews with Hidetaka Miyazaki, such as Eurogamer's Soul Survivor, makes me sad because I feel like his vision of multiplayer was truly stupendous, but the execution was very lackluster.\n\nCo-op makes the game too easy, breaking the intended experience of overcoming hardship, as the enemy AI are just not designed around dealing with multiple players, and the advantages of cooperation are so great that being invaded is more like a minor inconvenience than an actual threat.\n\nInvading can be fun, it can be tedious. What sucks though is that you cannot co-invade with friends. The second password summoning was made a thing back in Dark Souls 3, co-invasions should have also existed. If players can progress with friends, they should also be able to invade with them. Having to host and gank for co-op PvP or using the lackluster arena is just. . . boring.\n\nArena is lackluster. It somehow has less variety than the arena in Dark Souls 2 and 3. Three flat maps, one with pillars. . . excuse me?! Rather than using the password system, we need to be able to host lobbies and fine-tune rules so we don't just have one elimination mode and a bunch of timed death-match modes. Where is my 2v2 or 3v3 elimination?\n\nDue to how multiplayer works in this game, the lack of natural solo invasions, inability to be invaded in areas where the boss is cleared, lack of covenants, amongst other features missing from previous titles, Elden Ring does not really have a post end-game for those that fall in love with its mechanics but want to do something other than progress the story with the same enemy placement for the millionth time. Dark Souls 2 has some neat features that this game could really make use of ranging from multiplayer mechanics such as post-game invasions to new game plus features such as new enemy placement.\n\nIt sucks because I really like this game, but I really do not like the overall direction FromSoft/Bandai have been taking multiplayer where it has been started to feel more like a half-baked afterthought rather than an integral part to the core experience.", "timestamp_created": 1713741204, "timestamp_updated": 1713872296, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching Faide montages on YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died.

But I can't say I cared for any of the NPCs or the story.  The bosses had a threadbare backstory, and it didn't make them interesting nor did it make them sympathetic.  Honestly, why were these people fighting over the Lands Between which are just various flavors of depressing wastelands?\r\n\r\nThe open world is simply littered with monsters.  There are not any long pauses in fighting.  You better not stand around looking at the wasteland scenery lest you are attacked by roving monstrosities.  I didn't like that my character never felt particularly powerful.  It seems absurd that this peon could become Elden Lord, whatever that means anyway.  After awhile, things became repetitive.\r\n\r\nI do give this game credit for an option to exit to the desktop.  That is always appreciated.  But there were scant few accessibility options.

theorizing along with fellow players. The environmental storytelling is amazing, the plot is rich - provided by both known information and the lack of it - and integrates the many aspect of jobs and niches of people outside the world of video games (e.g. Tarnished Archeologist). \r\nWhile this is unmistakably a FromSoft game, I'd say it's a balanced gateway piece for more casual players, allowing them to discover their own play style while offering help in form of co-op and spirit summons. Also, the struggles and preferences in exploring the world allows one to delve inside their own psyche, finding out more about their inner struggles they've been suppressing IRL, as I've seen in the case of many of my friends and myself. \r\nIt may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I'd highly recommend giving it a try![/i]\r\n\r\nCan't wait for the DLC to drop!\r\n\r\n[i][b]MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD![/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1713620568, "timestamp_updated": 1713620568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163237394": {"recommendationid": "163237394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198884494866", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 764, "playtime_at_review": 3559, "last_played": 1714124122}, "language": "english", "review": ":3 ewden wing\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1713620212, "timestamp_updated": 1713620212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163236842": {"recommendationid": "163236842", "author": {"steamid": "76561199583882663", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2724, "playtime_at_review": 4292, "last_played": 1714182105}, "language": "english", "review": "After countless hours in Dark Souls 3 I played Elden Ring as soon as it came out. Playing through tend to take awhile due to the size of the world which is both good and bad. Its good because there's some things you can see in the distance early on and realize you're finally there later on.\r\nThere's a couple bosses that tend to feel annoying due to their constant movement or underwhelming after exploring. If you head straight to the areas legacy dungeon you might have a pretty hard time, but if you explore first you either sort of even the playing field or have an easy time.\r\nAlthough there are a number of bosses that don't apply to that exploration stuff and are hard unless you come back after beating most of the game. THESE bosses are why I like the game so much. True Souls bosses imo.\r\n\r\nIf you're into souls games it can be challenging enough to give you your much needed fix.\r\nIf you're into the gameplay and beauty of the world, you can still finish the game, you just need to explore which is why you're here right?\r\nIf you're into the gameplay but not much of an explorer, well, you might be here awhile. That feeling when you move on is gonna be great though\r\n\r\n\r\nAS FOR PVP. Its been a hot minute for me. I played when it came out and it kinda sucked hard. Like maybe the damage values needed some editing/balancing. As if they were more geared towards PvE. I've been playing Convergence mod+Seamless Co-Op with my buddy and we do some PvP here and there and it feels pretty balanced. Those are Genuine 1v1s though where as invasions will, AS FAR AS I'M AWARE, always be 2v1.\r\nTread carefully with your PvP experience and report any improvements you can think of.

That said, I can't not recommend it either. Is there a neutral review option? My view of this game is that it is great, but it needs refinement. The pros: The boss fights are (mostly) fantastic, the enemy design is great, the ambience is good, the music is good, everything feels (mostly) tough but fair (fuck you raygun lobsters and scarlet rot), and in general the worldbuilding and gameplay in general is amazing. That all said, you might wonder why I don't recommend it? Well, put simply, the quests. I'm sure this has been said to death: this game NEEDS A QUEST LOG. Also, the controller support is stupid.\n\nFor controller support: I don't understand why PC games don't have Playstation Controller support. Ridiculous that I need to install a mod just to see playstation glyphs or inputs, so I actually learn the proper controls. Especially when the game is made by a big, rich publisher, THAT ALSO PUT OUT THE GAME ON PLAYSTATION WITH THE CORRECT DISPLAY. You literally made the correct display, for a different platform, why can't you have the playstation controller glyphs as an option for PC???\n\nFor those of you that say, \"no it doesn't dark souls has never had a quest log!\" True. It's also never been open world and had so many questlines that could be broken without warning. The fact that simply heading to Liurnia or killing a specific boss early could end 2, 3, even 4 questlines for people I might not have even met yet, and cut off multiple different endings, is absurd. Also, when you speak to people, they give no indication, many times, where they are going! Good luck finding them again (Hyetta). Even more absurd, there is no warning. We saw this in The Witcher 3, when you collect Ciri, the game will warn you that some quests may be unable to complete. Why is this not a thing in Elden Ring? And the fact that some NPC's (Ranni) will lie about their real name (says she is Renna I believe), tell you that you won't meet again, and then proceed to be one of the most important ones in the game, is fucking baffling. Not only that, but with other questlines (Rya) unless you reload the game, she may not spawn, which also pisses me off. How can you lock her entire quest because \"I had a long play session without logging off so she didn't spawn and I missed her quest\". I didn't buy this game to spend more time on the damn wiki than in The Lands Between, thank you very much. \n\nSo, will I play this game again? Probably not. Like I said, I won't spend more time on the wiki, reading shit, than playing a game. I also won't buy the DLC, because I have a hard time believing it will be different.\n\nAnd for those about to \"clown emote\" my review, here is my suggestion to FromSoft and Bandai: for those of you that don't want a quest log, make it optional. We kind of saw this in AC Odyssey - you could have fully guided quests (markers, you knew where to go the minute you got/progressed a quest), or more vague ones - \"go to this location and look around, here's some hints and we recorded them for you in the quest log, then use your cool bird to find stuff.\" A system like that would work great in this game, in my opinion, and also make it more accessible to newbies.", "timestamp_created": 1713563081, "timestamp_updated": 1713568554, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471074372529983521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163193770": {"recommendationid": "163193770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068092473", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 714, "playtime_at_review": 5795, "last_played": 1713578493}, "language": "english", "review": "I am Malenia", "timestamp_created": 1713562890, "timestamp_updated": 1713562890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163193249": {"recommendationid": "163193249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036543490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5094, "playtime_at_review": 1503, "last_played": 1714085929}, "language": "english", "review": "Consider playing something like Dark Souls before buying this game or else you might get overwhelmed", "timestamp_created": 1713562299, "timestamp_updated": 1713562299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163192749": {"recommendationid": "163192749", "author": {"steamid": "76561199239650587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4327, "playtime_at_review": 19816, "last_played": 1714092631}, "language": "english", "review": "great game only thing bad about it is the co-op", "timestamp_created": 1713561756, "timestamp_updated": 1713561756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163192725": {"recommendationid": "163192725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085990303", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3001, "playtime_at_review": 2150, "last_played": 1714285447}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1713561732, "timestamp_updated": 1713561732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163192160": {"recommendationid": "163192160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814583543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4193, "playtime_at_review": 3510, "last_played": 1714285588}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME!", "timestamp_created": 1713561055, "timestamp_updated": 1713561055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163191740": {"recommendationid": "163191740", "author": {"steamid": "76561199230270531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3004, "playtime_at_review": 3709, "last_played": 1713814463}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lot to offer in terms of adventure and diffrent builds and weapons you can use there is probably some weapon you like in this game.

It wonderfully combines the basic souls-formula with a gorgeous (partially) open world, giving the player a choice in how long the experience will be. \nOne might only focus on the main story, and have an experience roughly the same length as Dark Souls 3, while an explorer or quest enthusiast might spend up to 100 hours on a single run. \n\nThe world is absolutely beautiful, and the game runs quite smoothly on a worse than average setup. The story is pretty good, and if one pays a little extra attention to dialogue (and item texts, and does multiple quest-lines, and explores, and...) I'd say the story is REALLY good. Excellent even.\n\nHowever the biggest flaw in this game is in the way that story is told. As in most soulsborne-games, it can be a bit tedious to piece the whole lore-puzzle together. Especially for players who might play this as their first souls like game. \nSome bosses are repeats with a twist, but most bosses are quite epic & memorable. I'd say this game has probably the best boss fights in the series, together with Sekiro.\n\nNevertheless, small flaws in a huge machine.

They've adapted to the open world well - I always preferred the DS1-style world, that's still their best work, but this is great.  It's got the haunting/beautiful combination down pat, though the overall tone is a bit lighter.\n\nI'm not very good at these games, but I've played them to death anyway, because the gameplay/combat is just so fun, even if you kinda suck.  There are a few new mechanics to help out a bit - you can always summon help for bosses or certain other encounters, even offline; invasions are way toned down; and there's something you can access early on to gain levels quickly when you're underpowered [discover it on your own, I was shocked/thrilled when I did!  but by now it's in guides if you need em].

Elden Ring is the only game I know of so far that tells the story the way it does. What I'm saying is it has a unique way of telling the story of elden ring. It does so by the environment itself. The world of elden ring will tell its story in a very unique way that no other game provides as far as I've seen.\r\nEven though I haven't beaten the game,and know the ending there multiple endings,but I have put in this many hours into a game I haven't even beaten yet, so I got my moneys worth.

DLC is coming up so now is the best time to get into the vast open world of Elden Ring.", "timestamp_created": 1713482161, "timestamp_updated": 1713482161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163133023": {"recommendationid": "163133023", "author": {"steamid": "76561199481195770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1335, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1713741072}, "language": "english", "review": "so good \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f so good badabuyuhuhuhu WAAA", "timestamp_created": 1713481992, "timestamp_updated": 1713481992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163132698": {"recommendationid": "163132698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066418178", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1137, "playtime_at_review": 3726, "last_played": 1714004997}, "language": "english", "review": "fun if you are strong or good good for cordanatin", "timestamp_created": 1713481531, "timestamp_updated": 1713481531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163131869": {"recommendationid": "163131869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331299671", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 820, "playtime_at_review": 7594, "last_played": 1713637459}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game if you feel like losing your sanity", "timestamp_created": 1713480406, "timestamp_updated": 1713480406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163131578": {"recommendationid": "163131578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077636229", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 7834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 473, "playtime_at_review": 7361, "last_played": 1713932911}, "language": "english", "review": "I've rejected all Souls games until this one then one day I found myself doing a Malenia no damage video.

(Tho i should wait until i beat previous Dark Souls before saying that ... I will)\nSo if you never managed to play a FromSoft game but always wanted to, i recommand starting with this one\nWith some precautions tho - the game is big, really big. I spent 80h, but i'm sure i could have spend 30 more hours, there's plenty of dungeons i didn't explore etc ... \n\nThere's obviously some flaws coming with such a ambitious wide design, some (a lot) of bosses are reused, which isn't too much of an issue imho, but it's something to be aware of. A lot of dungeons are pretty much copy pasted, but once again, you don't have to do them all, except if you want every piece of loot. \n\nSome boss fight are frustrating : duo boss fights sucks imho, and there's a few of them. Some attacks seem a bit unfair etc ..., but overall, it's really an enjoyable journey. Just be ready to use everything the game gives you, because the game won't hold back, for the best and the worst. \nThere's a lot of different builds available, and the game makes respecing quite accessible, which is great, because you can respec for one boss if you struggle too much. Some boss also suffer from awful camera placement (most dragons for instance). But overall, they are good, some are trully great.\n\nA lot of weapons, but every cool weapons is locked behind magic stats, which kinda sucks if you want to play with a pure melee fighter, because you won't get to use 90% of the loot. \nArmour is mostly for fashion, which isn't a bad thing imho (there's already plenty of things to manage), except that a lot of armours really don't match together, especially because of very different metal tints. \n \nThe biggest strenght of the game is the world design. Gorgeous ! Some places are simply breathtaking, and it shows that a lot of care was put into it. If you enjoy fantasy worlds, this one is great ! A lot of inspiration from different things (Berserk obviously, this is a From Soft game) but other things too !\n\nThe story is kinda cryptic like From Soft usually does, but i enjoyed it. I'll be watching lore videos about it so i can get the whole picture ! NPCs writting is a bit lazy tho. Like, i don't mind having cryptic things and etc, but a lot of them seems almost parodic. Sidequests kinda share the same flaws, you will probably need to read a guide to finish them, but some are great !\n\nOverall i think Elden Ring is a great experience, i think their goal was to make a more accessible game without making too much compromise, and i think they achieved that in a very impressive way. If you are a knowledgable player of previous From Soft games, you might get rebuted by the flaws i mentionned ; because of the size of the game, it can't be such a polished experience as previous games. The size is a strenght and a flaw.\nI'm definitely looking forward the DLC which seem to be massive !", "timestamp_created": 1713464918, "timestamp_updated": 1713465077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163118502": {"recommendationid": "163118502", "author": {"steamid": "76561199490886479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 602, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1713585986}, "language": "english", "review": "GREAT GAME\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1713464694, "timestamp_updated": 1713464694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163117893": {"recommendationid": "163117893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368226996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 15300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15300, "last_played": 1672656138}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is darn expensive for sure but it is worth your time and buck still waiting on the dlc but when it does comes out will purchase it without hesitation. 100/10", "timestamp_created": 1713464123, "timestamp_updated": 1713464123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163117529": {"recommendationid": "163117529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215733688", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 23712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "playtime_at_review": 23704, "last_played": 1713464767}, "language": "english", "review": "My beloved <3", "timestamp_created": 1713463796, "timestamp_updated": 1713463796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163117256": {"recommendationid": "163117256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042445918", "num_games_owned": 1803, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 27194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2583, "playtime_at_review": 25337, "last_played": 1714278878}, "language": "english", "review": "My most played game on steam and probably my favorite game of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1713463525, "timestamp_updated": 1713463525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163117229": {"recommendationid": "163117229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362068020", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2516, "playtime_at_review": 2481, "last_played": 1713909009}, "language": "english", "review": "eglenring", "timestamp_created": 1713463501, "timestamp_updated": 1713463501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163116621": {"recommendationid": "163116621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092210076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 10593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 278, "playtime_at_review": 10415, "last_played": 1713891264}, "language": "english", "review": "Try finger", "timestamp_created": 1713462914, "timestamp_updated": 1713462914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163115303": {"recommendationid": "163115303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238335280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 51253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2057, "playtime_at_review": 50498, "last_played": 1713662390}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] YES - It is a MUST [/h1]\n\n[h3] PROS: [/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]It is [b] BY FAR [/b] the most forgiving Fromsoft game ever. Ashes of war, cooperative open world, cheese points, explore get stronger and come back. Yes, it is unforgiving, but it gives you tons of tools to get over tough spots.\n    [*]The open world is gorgeous, simply gorgeous.\n    [*]The amount of weapons classes with their movesets is more than interesting.\n    [*]Ashes of war is by far the part I most enjoy, they keep the combat feeling fresh.\n    [*]Carian Blade sorceries are super cool, not easy to time correctly but satisfying when you land a successful hit.\n    [*]Combat animations are super well crafted (have some nitpicking about timing but not here).\n    [*]Sinergy between temporary effects, statuses, attack types, buffs and debuffs is beautiful, deep and exquisitely crafted.\n    [*]Armors. They're beatiful, and there's a fairly good amount of them.\n    [*]Varied enemy gallery that keeps you on your toes with dtheir different movesets, alemental affinities and weaknesses.\n    [*]Incantations are varied and feel super satisfying to cast.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h3] CONS: [/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]The lock-on targeting system really, I mean [b] REALLY [/b] needs a rework. It is super inconsistent to the point it will [b] NOT [/b] target a guy that's directly in front of you but will target a guy that's behind a wall and a flight of stairs 30+ mts away from you. The lock-on system has killed me more than enemies by straight on deviating a precise hit or making me walk to a precipice (Dragon's Dogma would never do that to me).\n    [*]Stamina management is very good and I enjoy it, but considering special moves also consume FP, would you Fromsoft [b] AT LEAST [/b] not give me that much delay between attach chains?? I mean animations look cool but damage is only registered in a segment of it, rest of the time I'm open for attacks (that have way more reach than me even using the same weapon btw) so 0.2sec is [b] A LOT [/b] of time, enough to get rekt. Also, why can't I chain an attack with a roll if I have stamina?\n    [*]Boss weapons, some are awesome but most are... Disappointingly lame. Gargoyle weapons suck 4$$, Crystal weapons are extremely lame. I can undertsnd not being able to apply Ashes of War, but why can't I infuse the non-affinity types with some with an element?\n    [*]Sorceries are a tricky point, some very powerful ones but they're all some variation of \"blue light goes *bling*\".  Sorry Fromsoft but terribly uninspired and not satisfying at all.\n    [*]Crystallian gear and sorceries do what again???? Oh never mind, they're sligtly cooler looking than some other armaments/sorceries. For real??? What a terribly missed oportunity.\n    [*]Flame Monk Curved Sword is so dificcult to farm and has 0 special traits that is a complete disappointment, alongside Black/Flame Monk attire, like why the heck do they not give you a slight boost maybe in casting fire/black fire incantations? Or have the black flame incantation effect last longer in Flame Monk's armaments, or make Black Flame stronger with the full set and weapon but weaken your Magick/Holy damage output/resistance..??? Not the only case in which there are missed opportunities: Hoslow's full set should give you a slight higher evade window (since Juno is so mobile), Diallos' mask should give you decreased DEX but increase damage resist while using the Noble shield (since Diallos is weaker than Juno which makes him dependent on his shield). Marais mask shouls give you a slightly faster attack rate with Regalia of Eochaid or Marais Executioner Sword (ok I'm stretching it but you get my point: we have to farm specifically for things that are not specially rewarding).\n    [*]Why the horrible downgrade to the Serpent Hunter greatspear outside the Rykard arena????????? Yeah yeah, don't give me the super bombastic wind blasting spear ability but man... that super slow SHORT RANGE attack??? Of course is very effective if you level STR but it for sure does not feel satisfying to use. At all. Horrible downgrade.\n    [*]Weapon range unbalanced AF. Enemies using your same weapon and ability will have longer reach than you. Some enemies have their damage dealing window last longer than the attack itself: I can roll and avoid the first imapct and then roll again to avoid the explosion/AOE but for some reason I'm getting rekt even when enemy attack is over..? Why? Because otherwise you'll be OP..? Bro, strong enemies can still pretty much one shot me and I still can beat the crap out of weaker enemies, no need for the reach to be that unbalanced. Weak point here.\n    [*]Overly repeated boss reuse. The only situation in which is ok to do it is Margit/Morgott, Mohg the Omen/Lord of Blood, the Crucible Knights, and the Ancient Hero of Zamor because is a piece of storytelling. I'm not talking about field bosses, but actual Bosses.\n    [*]I understand the \"dead world\" scenario Fromsoft always depicts but this isn't supposed to be one as the story goes, but a world in the *process* of dying. Melina herself would ask you (if you accept the Frenzied Flame) why destroy everything if life keeps on being born, which makes no sense since everyone is either a raging zombie, a zombie soldier, a sad-sits-in-its-place zombie, a zombie boss, a demigod, a quest giver or a tarnished; no life being born at all. It is a dead world, but is inconsistent with what NPCs tell us. Love you Fromsoft but weak point here.\n    [*]Weird framerate drops even at ultra low resolution (thought it was that but apparently nope)\n    [*]Weird crashes while trying to connect to multiplayer (mostly collosseum but open world too)\n[/list]\n\n\n[h2] CONCLUSION: [/h2]\nDefinitely worth playing. If you keep dying, try again until you git gud. The struggle is worth it cause that feeling when you get bettter is mmmmmm *chef kiss*", "timestamp_created": 1713461540, "timestamp_updated": 1713461540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163114853": {"recommendationid": "163114853", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970763385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1701488816}, "language": "english", "review": "Because I liked it.", "timestamp_created": 1713461082, "timestamp_updated": 1713461082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163114527": {"recommendationid": "163114527", "author": {"steamid": "76561199668187116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3264, "playtime_at_review": 2131, "last_played": 1714283045}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has some of the combat and variation of builds ive ever seen in a game. and the exploration..

The sense of discovery is unparalleled; every corner holds secrets waiting to be unearthed, every vista a breathtaking testament to the game's meticulous design.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay mechanics are both familiar and innovative, seamlessly blending the punishing difficulty of Soulsborne titles with the freedom and exploration of an open-world RPG.

Mastering each encounter feels like a triumph of both intellect and reflexes.\r\n\r\nBut what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its narrative depth and world-building. FromSoftware has crafted a mythos so intricately woven that every character, every piece of dialogue, every item holds significance. The lore is not spoon-fed; it's there for those willing to delve deep, adding layers of meaning to every action and decision.\r\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the mounted combat \u2013 a game-changer that adds a new dimension to exploration and combat.

You can even go ham on an aggression build, and while you won't fully get something as satisfying as Bloodborne it's more than you can pull off in any of the other like titles. The lore is going to take you a long time to wrap your head around even if you are an avid reader. This game does not give you a story that makes sense until you speak to everyone and read every item description and even then it's based on the context of your choices and individual perceptions. You almost have to collaborate with other peoples experiences to get a full picture, much like Dark Souls but bigger. It scratches that itch, being a massive game, one of the largest ever successfully developed but filled with zero fetch quests or pointless content, it's all interesting and not at all repetitive. Everything has a point and a purpose and it is astonishingly impressive that they pulled that off within a semi non linear world. The Witcher 3 did this 2nd best and it's still full of time wasting errands that are just there to inflate the amount of time you spend with the game. The graphics are top notch, the game play is great if you like souls games, the magic system is very much expanded but not at all required, the story is an enigma and it's your job to decipher it and share your findings, the sound design and music are in my opinion 2nd only to Bloodborne, the replayability is an art itself and it's perfect here. Need I say more? In a world where supposed AAA devs are ripping people off left and right this game is worth way more than the listed price. You'll be at it for years and you won't regret a minute, well except for mistakes that you can only really blame on yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1713393379, "timestamp_updated": 1713393379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163070150": {"recommendationid": "163070150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085789218", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 11309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1978, "playtime_at_review": 9333, "last_played": 1714173065}, "language": "english", "review": "Elden ring is as good as hitting a fent cart. 1 2 buckly my shoe, skibidi rizz", "timestamp_created": 1713392963, "timestamp_updated": 1713392963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163069890": {"recommendationid": "163069890", "author": {"steamid": "76561199384927948", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5385, "playtime_at_review": 2239, "last_played": 1714270478}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is absolutely insane aye", "timestamp_created": 1713392532, "timestamp_updated": 1713392532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163069408": {"recommendationid": "163069408", "author": {"steamid": "76561199450663502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 815, "playtime_at_review": 3329, "last_played": 1714235134}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes 10/10 Everything, recommend this", "timestamp_created": 1713391731, "timestamp_updated": 1713391731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163068932": {"recommendationid": "163068932", "author": {"steamid": "76561199214584764", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1220, "playtime_at_review": 2222, "last_played": 1713735091}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD GAME RECCOMEND HIGHLY", "timestamp_created": 1713391050, "timestamp_updated": 1713391050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163068178": {"recommendationid": "163068178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280775046", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 52550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1401, "playtime_at_review": 52528, "last_played": 1713395552}, "language": "english", "review": "GOAT", "timestamp_created": 1713389911, "timestamp_updated": 1713389911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163067752": {"recommendationid": "163067752", "author": {"steamid": "76561199120417969", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "playtime_at_review": 2622, "last_played": 1713764579}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has made me want to die over, and over, and over, and over.

"review": "I recommend this for everyone who has the time to explore this game to the fullest and spend the time needed to make the game worth buying. As a big fan of the DS franchise aswell as BB and in general Souls-like games i was very disappointed about the greater game design but specially the boss design. There are a few bosses that seem like they received the same love every DS boss received. But then there is a ton  of bosses who seem to be made with the idea \"from software games must be hard so the bosses must be annoying and just spamming attacks because we dont have the time to spend the time needed to make a challenging boss.\" If this game would have had two more years in development and world building it could have been what it seemingly wanted to be, a darksouls similar game but with an open world. But it was released with bad bosses who are very repetitive, have no complexity in their move set and just spam their attacks. Nothing to learn about, no way to get into most of their move sets because their are no gaps to find its just dodge dodge dodge hit  and so on. The open world is incredibly empty but the dungeons and castles you do find are fun to play through and the bosses you find are fun if you find and fight one of them for the first time. My personal problem with the game is the strong push towards playing magic builds. As someone who loves it to wield a big sword or axe and wear cool looking armor this game is less enjoyable. The run i have where i build strength was very exhausting and no fun at all. The magic focused run was way easier especially with the bosses but still not what i look for in a souls-like. If you like open world games with a lot to explore and fun challenging areas this is a game you might have fun with but be warned about the boss fights they are less fun than most other games from this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1713384511, "timestamp_updated": 1713384511, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48092120885848999", "comment_count": 0,

The multiplayer is clunky, but it was a design choice to get you thinking about the \"fingers\" in the lore more. There is no way to compare a merchant's equipment to the (up to three sets at the same time) equipped gear. \n\nI stuck with it enough to make it through a cave and travel across a large section of the map (Spoiler: I got to the \"roundtable\" map location). I am not sure if it is worth playing based on the QOL approach that the devs have taken to this thing.\n\nThere isn't much that I am spoiling if you have gone through the tutorial, so I am going to just say \"Things I wish I knew when I started\":\n1) \"runes\" are coins that enemies drop when killed and they are auto collected. \"XXX runes\" are items that you collect where XXX is any adjective. Note that the coins you have drop when you die and despawn if you die again before picking them up. Note that items stay with you forever. This was explained like 3 times but the fact that the exact same word is the noun between those two made me still think I was going to lose my \"golden rune\", \"smithing rune\", etc. whenever I died.\n2) the way to make any in-game progression is to either\n - grind to get \"good\" by dying several times memorizing boss and creature \"tells\" on what they will do next\n - grind to get \"overleveled\" by rune-coin farming and spending the coins on levels. (you kill stuff, auto collect rune-coins, touch \"respawn point\" to revive all enemies, rinse repeat) then buy level stat upgrades.\n - partially cheese any boss by using either \"summon spirit ashes\" or \"multiplayer summon online player\" to help you defeat the local boss then your helper despawns\n - get better gear, but all the merchants have \"tutorial level gear\", so make due and progress the game in other ways via grinding THEN access areas with better gear?\n3) You need to \"touch grass\" often. Substantially all enemies respawn when you \"touch grass\" aka the respawn \"touch grace light\" locations. Also substantially all enemies respawn when you die and respawn. Unless you \"fast travel\" to a \"touch grass\" point, you will spend your time \"grinding\" to just travel unless you get the horse.\n4) Spoiler: you get the horse by touching 3 unique grasses (not in dungeon) then [EDIT] visit the first location (a church's grass) at night or by dying and respawning at that first church's grass.\nSpoiler: you get the spirit bell to summon \"spirit ashes\" by [EDIT] having the horse and wating at least 1 day where you ride the horse then visiting the first church's grass at night or dying and respawning at the first church's ashes.\n5) Multiplayer messages and \"blood stains\" showing deaths are the only predictable interactions with players. This gives info about \"be cautious\" or secrets.\n\nBased on all the info i have gotten from the game, Its UX is going to be clunkier regarding QOL and I don't want to spend my time doing grinding to be able to hit \"bigger things\" with my tutorial sword.", "timestamp_created": 1713337616, "timestamp_updated": 1713408233, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436507940292358398", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163030653": {"recommendationid": "163030653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038514999", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2326, "playtime_at_review": 1660, "last_played": 1713728004}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficult at first, many secrets, deep gameplay.

Spoiler alert: it was like trying to juggle flaming swords while riding a unicycle on a tightrope. In other words, it was an absolute circus.\r\n\r\nFirst off, let's talk about character creation. I spent a good hour tweaking my avatar's nose length, only to realise later that in the grand scheme of things, it didn't matter because my face was going to be hidden behind a helmet 99% of the time. Thanks for letting me agonise over nostril size, FromSoftware.\r\n\r\nThen there's the combat. Oh boy, the combat. I swung my sword like a toddler flailing at a pi\u00f1ata, hoping for some sweet loot to fall out. But instead, I got a swift kick in the teeth from a skeletal knight who probably chuckled at my feeble attempts. And don't even get me started on the dodge mechanic\u2014I dodged right into more trouble than I dodged out of. It's like my character had a death wish.\r\n\r\nExploration? Yeah, that was a laugh. I set out to conquer the vast open world of Elden Ring, only to find myself lost in the woods faster than Hansel and Gretel on a sugar rush. Every time I thought I was making progress, a giant monster or a gang of bandits would pop out of nowhere and remind me that I was just a puny mortal in a world of pain.\r\n\r\nOh, and let's not forget the story. I'm sure it's deep and meaningful, with layers upon layers of lore waiting to be uncovered. But honestly, I was too busy trying not to get skewered by a dragon to pay attention to the intricacies of the plot. Call me when there's a \"Casual Gamer\" difficulty setting that comes with a CliffsNotes version of the storyline.\r\n\r\nBut you know what? Despite all the frustration, Elden Ring somehow managed to keep me coming back for more punishment. Maybe it's the gorgeous landscapes, or the adrenaline rush of finally taking down a boss after a hundred failed attempts. Or maybe I'm just a glutton for punishment. Either way, Elden Ring gets a solid 10 out of 10 for making me feel simultaneously triumphant and utterly incompetent. It's a special kind of masochism, and I can't get enough of it.", "timestamp_created": 1713320282, "timestamp_updated": 1713320282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477707028388977051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "163021314": {"recommendationid": "163021314", "author": {"steamid": "76561199454161899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 179, "playtime_at_review": 3754, "last_played": 1713319791}, "language": "english", "review": "Elden Ring was a great game to play through.

Praise what is worthy of praise, and boo what is worthy of booing.

About a year later, my girlfriend and our mutual friend started playing it and suggested that I give it a try. I told them bluntly, \"I don't know if I'm going to play it. It looks kinda boring in my opinion.\" They urged me to buy it and if I didn't like it, to return it and get my money back. Elden Ring then proceeded to death grip me and became the only game I played consistently since. \n\nIn almost every conceivable way, Elden Ring is nearly the textbook definition of perfection. The story, albeit very difficult to grasp without looking up a breakdown of it online, is deep and rich. The open worldness of the game lets you pick your own progression path, and generally allows you to get any items you want at any time (except for progression locked areas like Mountaintop of the Giants, Consecrated Snowfield, Crumbling Farum Azula, and the Haligtree). There is a massive number of different types of items to utilize throughout the game, and creates an amazing opportunity to try different character builds across different playthroughs. \nMost importantly, the game play itself is a chef's kiss. I went into Elden Ring thinking I could beat the ever living piss out of everything and tank most hits with minimal consequence, and I was dead wrong. This game challenges and forces you learn how to play it, and its learning curve is steep at times, but is largely enjoyable and engaging from early game through to end game. But at every single point, it is satisfying to look back on the bosses and sections of the game that seemed impossible but now are a cake walk.\n\nFrom being a person who thought they were going to hate Elden Ring to someone who considers it their favorite game of all time, I highly suggest everyone to give Elden Ring a try. You could always return it within two hours if you end up not liking it... (but in some way, I guarantee you will)", "timestamp_created": 1713281006, "timestamp_updated": 1713281006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

"english", "review": "This was my first experience with a souls-like game and I think I started from the top. So, when I started the game for the first time, they showed me a short cutscene and just put me into the game with no specific missions, no journal, no characters around me except for one dude who literally told me to get some maidens. There is no indication on where to go and what to do. So, you know, you just start walking around and in front of you is a knight that is 5 times bigger than you and if he notices you, he one shots you. \r\n\r\nAnyway, after walking around and exploring I started to get some weapons, runes etc. but still have no idea what to do. So, I did the only thing I could do, just started riding the horse around the place and found myself in Caelid, which is the Australia of Elden Ring. And that wasn't a fun experience because, again, there is no indication on where you can go and where you should go-avoid. So you only know where you shouldn't be after getting eaten by dogs that are 4x your size.\r\n\r\nJokes aside, I usually try to go everywhere in games, explore every detail so that I don't miss out on stuff but in Elden Ring, that is very hard to do. So I always had this feeling that I am missing content. After playing for about 35-40 hours I started watching-reading some guides so that I don't completely miss out on important stuff and this being my first souls-like game, it helped. So, if you like souls-like games, just go on this journey without looking at anything but for me, playing with a guide was actually really fun. I played the game on a 1440p monitor with max settings with a 4090 and graphics are out of this world, so often, I stopped to take pictures or just look at the views because the game is looking gorgeous. I mean, what else to say, one of the best games ever created both gameplay and graphics wise. Story is also good but not having journals or mission descriptions can make you forget some of the parts of the story but I suppose that's just how these games are.

There are way too many caves and catacombs. I mean that this feels repetitive from level design to boss variety. It feels like the department for items, ash of war and spells was outperforming the level design department and they just said, \" screw this, we copy and paste from now on to include all that crap\". fewer but better caves and catacombs would have been the much better choice in my opinion.\n2. ER is lacking the dense atmosphere of former Fromsoft games. I know I shouldn\u2019t compare it to Dark Souls as ER is its own thing.

I still had good times playing it.\n\nThe combat is similar to the Dark Souls series, which is fine, but there are still some clunky controls present, such as input queueing, input delays, and certain unnecessary animations that can't be canceled to roll.\n\nCamera still suck, it's nightmare when you fight the big bosses or in tight room, your camera will be your biggest enemy because you can't see things. The lock-on feature can maybe worse, if it lock-on legs or hand of big bosses when they attacking, the camera will spin a lot and made me dizzy.\n\nThe world in Elden Ring is beautiful and has great world-building. The graphics may not be good, but the game has a great art style that makes the world look stunning. They have created a large map, but it lacks enough content. There are many similar dungeons with slightly different layouts, filled with enemies that we have already encountered countless times. At the end of these dungeons, we often encounter the same bosses with fewer movesets and your reward most of the times is shit-tier items you never use. \n\nThey don't even bother adding a journal for players to keep track of their next moves. You will find yourself looking for a wiki or YouTube a lot to find out your next move, which is bad. The side quests are even worse. The NPC who gives you the quest may give you a hint about where they're going or which item you'll need, but most of the time they just don't. It's not a big problem in previous titles because the map is small or even linear, so you can just play the game and still stumble upon them by chance. But in ER, the map is so large, it's very hard to keep track on quest, it's very to miss or ruined the entire quest.\n\nFromSoftware is the best when it comes to creating boss fights. There are 238 bosses in this game, which is quite unbelievable. However, most of them are either copy-pasted or trash mobs that appear later in the game. I can only count about 20 bosses that are worth mentioning. They have very good designs but BS because their spamming of AOE moves, infinite stamina, huge hitboxes, absurd damage and long combos. \n\nThe final boss is the worst final boss FS has ever made. Radagon is fine; he's challenging but still fair. However, the Elden Beast is an extremely frustrating fight. It unnecessarily long the battle because most of the time I can't even touch the creature. Whenever I get close, it teleports to another side of the map and relentlessly spams homing spells at you. What makes it even worse is that you don't even have Torrent with you, which is BS. And if you die, you have to find Radagon all over again. Have fun with that. \n\nIt may seem like I really hate this game because I've complained a lot. But to be honest, it's a great game to play, and I still recommend everyone to at least try it once. This is the first time FromSoftware has made an open-world game, and they did a very good job. However, it still has a lot of flaws. I hope they will take a look at them and fix them if they decide to make another game like Elden Ring.", "timestamp_created": 1713255354, "timestamp_updated": 1713256213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162972963": {"recommendationid": "162972963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125166392", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 15570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1687, "playtime_at_review": 14257, "last_played": 1714235733}, "language": "english", "review": "Miyazaki you've done it again", "timestamp_created": 1713254666, "timestamp_updated": 1713254666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162972931": {"recommendationid": "162972931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038944351", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8670, "last_played": 1712833324}, "language": "english", "review": "Bat.

From the visionary minds at FromSoftware, creators of the acclaimed Souls series, and the masterful storytelling of Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R.R. Martin comes a gaming experience that sets new standards for the medium.\r\n\r\nAt its heart, \"Elden Ring\" is about exploration and discovery. The Lands Between, a vast and interconnected realm, invites players to chart their own course through its sprawling landscapes, each more breathtaking and perilous than the last. Whether traversing dense forests, scaling treacherous mountains, or delving into the depths of forgotten ruins, every step is a testament to the game's unparalleled world design.\r\n\r\nBut it's not just the world itself that mesmerizes; it's the stories it holds. \"Elden Ring\" weaves a rich tapestry of lore and mythology, drawing players into a narrative that is as enigmatic as it is compelling. From ancient legends to tragic histories, every character, every location, every encounter is steeped in significance, waiting to be uncovered by those brave enough to seek them out.\r\n\r\nOf course, no discussion of \"Elden Ring\" would be complete without mentioning its challenging yet deeply satisfying gameplay. Combat is a ballet of steel and sorcery, demanding precision, timing, and strategy. From epic clashes against towering bosses to tense skirmishes with cunning adversaries, every encounter is a test of skill and perseverance, rewarding those who dare to face its trials head-on.\r\n\r\nYet perhaps what truly sets \"Elden Ring\" apart is its sense of freedom. Unlike many open-world games, it doesn't just give players a vast playground to explore; it gives them agency, allowing them to shape their own destiny within its world.

The open world aspect is kind of boring, but not enough to make me mad. Story is still mostly whatever but at least respects your time which I can appreciate as usual. The post-processing is a fucking abomination.\n\nIn more details:\nGameplay:\n+faster everything, less of a snooze-fest\n+a lot of efforts made to break away from the series' well-known monotone roll-stab-roll-stab, shield-stab-shield-stab one-on-one is-it-my-turn-yet fights\n.....a strong focus on group fights, both one-vs-many and many-vs-many, naturally bringing variety and tension in fights and rewarding agressivity\n.....lots of enemies now designed to make you use a variety of defensive maneuvers in a single fight, trying to make you switch between dodging, running away, ducking, jumping, circling around, blocking, parrying, or stunning the opponent\n.....more meaningful variety in attacks too, with guard counters to spice up sword-and-board gameplay and jumping attacks or charged attacks as high-risk high-reward moves to stun enemies and open them up for further punishment\n.....very interesting ashes of war system that allows the customization of one attack as well as the stats of every basic weapon and creates an incentive for switching between one-handed and two-handed weapon handling mid-battle\n.....mounted battle\n+pvp truly optional\n+monsters' physical and elemental resistances actually somewhat important, yet another incentive to switch up your gameplay\n+much more difficult, but still very reasonable difficulty\n\n-still impossible to pause the game, even with multiplayer being now optional\n-still long-ass useless 'you died' screen to waste your time, especially during pseudo-multiplayer when you're invading npcs\n-a lot of damage sponges\n\nWorld:\nThe open world nature of the game creates a lot of downtime during exploration that you may or may not like. It also features some of the most blatant copy-pasting that I've ever seen in my life in big productions. I don't particularly mind it, but it is certainly noteworthy. You'll see the same rooms, the same rock formations, the same elevator shafts... dozens of times each.\n\nGraphics:\nI honestly think that the artists that have worked on this game must be mad about their art director. The decors, characters and animations aren't outstanding, but they're certainly very nice. Miles better than anything I could produce of course, and well worth the probable dozens of millions invested to make them. So where was the need to throw it all down the drain with all that unbearable post-processing? If you were to play it vanilla, you'd see the game's beautiful artwork through the lens of: at least four layers of blurring (anti-aliasing, motion blur, depth of field, chromatic aberration), at least three ways of fucking up the lighting (vignette, auto-exposure, lens flare), ridiculously strong color filters and a thick layer of volumetric fog. It makes me think of those face-blurring filters that you have on tv to protect people's anonymity. Trying one's hardest to turn a normal image into an incomprehensible smudge on the screen. Obviously one's hardest is a bit of an exaggeration here since it's just enabling a few checkboxes on your game engine, but still, I can't play this game vanilla for more than ten minutes without hurting my eyes. I'm not joking. A blurry mess, flashes of blinding lights and deep darkness randomly alternating every few seconds and a view distance of ten meters. That is the shocking reality of vanilla Elden Ring graphics.\nI suppose all modern AAA games are like that by default, but I wouldn't know because 1. I don't play that many AAA games, 2. In the vast majority of those games, you can disable those stupid effects. But here you can't. Or well, you can't except for depth of field and motion blur, which is already something I guess. I couldn't bear it so I played the game modded to remove whatever effect I could, and you certainly should do the same. Honestly, if I didn't know that you can alleviate that problem through mods, I wouldn't recommend the game based on that point alone as it is absolutely unacceptable.", "timestamp_created": 1713202089, "timestamp_updated": 1713202162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162940662": {"recommendationid": "162940662", "author": {"steamid": "76561199437925365", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 717, "last_played": 1709576279}, "language": "english", "review": "1st of all, I have beaten this game on PS side (all bosses) so don't mind the gameplay time.\n\nELDEN R\u00d6NG. Been playing this since beta test and gotta say this is a mixed bag if something. It's beautiful to watch and listen to (I was mesmerized of the main theme for a long time) but sadly, the gameplay - or the way this game makes you play is a letdown. I mean the diversity of player builds, There are a few builds that absolutely bulldozer the whole game, so the so-called freedom is not there; literally you take a spear, infuse it with bleed, take a shield and that's it. - you are nigh-invincible. Congrats, feel free to kill everything. The game even MAKES you do this, because some of the bosses are full of one-shot killing gimmicks, especially that one.... you know, THE one. I played over 100 hours and then I had to change my whole build to beat her. Yes, I  know it's a SKILL issue also, because I kinda suck at souls-likes, even though I have beaten DARK SOULS 3 several times and some others I won't list here. \n\nAfter changing my build the little rest of the game was easy-peasy and so on.. the point being it's an OK game to beat - ONCE.\n\nLater, I bought this game again (momentary lapse of reason), this time for PC. It was kinda nice at first, looks better than on PS and yadda-yadda... then I realized, after ten or so hours... this is absolute crock. This game is an absolute Bore after the first \"round\". Co-op is boring, bosses are boring, everything feels like a chore and the list goes on and on...\n\nI won't be buying the DLC, I won't be playing this anymore. so guess I just don't like ER. I understand people who love this game, the lore is interesting, and like I said it's a beautiful game to watch and listen to. Sadly the most important thing, the actual game, is just hollow. DARK SOULS 3 is a masterpiece, ER is: Put a ring on it - and divorce after the honeymoon. That is the ELDEN R\u00d6NG.

And there is a lot this game has to offer besides the main story path.\n\nElden Ring is my first Fromsoft game, and it got me hooked, even though I usually don't like dying over and over again. \nBut this game isn't unfair. It offers so many possibilities to play it and make it easier for yourself, if you do wish so. \nAnd even if you die a lot, you probably learned something from it. I still remember how it made me feel to finally beat the Tree Sentinel at the start of the game, after dying to it over and over again and almost losing hope, but not quite wanting to give up. It was truly exciting and invigorating to finally defeat it.\n\nIf that doesn't sound like an experience you want to go through, then maybe the game really just isn't for you.

Among FromSoft's catalog of excellent games, it stands as the pinnacle of everything they've done thus far. Few games come close to Elden Ring in the value that it provides: a sprawling open world to explore, some of the most creative enemy and boss designs ever put in a game, engaging combat, intriguing lore and unique worldbuilding, and so, so much replay value. There's so many different builds you can create that fundamentally change how combat feels and you approach the game. For example, here's a quick rundown of how different my builds have been between playthroughs: \r\n\r\n1st. Colossal Sword & Greatshield - A Strength heavy build meant to tank damage and hit hard. This is basically the character I've been playing since Dark Souls 1. Looking back, it's a slow and cautious way to play the game, and I was missing out on so much by sticking with that build. \r\n2nd. Sorceries & Cold - My first Magic build. Create distance, and use spells to deal damage and buff yourself. This was the first time I truly melted a boss. Comet Azur and Terra Magica is a brutal combo. While you can hit enemies from far away, you're more fragile without the strong defense of a shield. \r\n3rd. Dexterity & Bleed - Getting close and cutting quickly with katanas is everything. Unlike my strength build, I have no shield to protect me; I have only my dodge to rely on. This has been my favorite playthrough so far because the fights feel more intense, but I've been blasting through the game like never before.\r\n\r\nI already have plans for at least two more builds I want to play through the game with (Faith build, then Dragon Knight). With each time through the game, I've found more and more things I've missed each time. It makes me realize how truly massive Elden Ring is, and I still enjoy the game as much after 220 hours as I did after just 5. You will get your money's worth out of this game.

"language": "english", "review": "     1,000 hours later, I think it's finally time I gave my thoughts on this game. I've been meaning to do this for a long, long time but my opinions on the game kept changing, not changing, and everything in between. I've done dozens upon dozens of playthroughs for the other souls game and this one is no different in that regard but it's also been by far the most polarizing to me out of all them. To tell you the truth, another reason why I held off on doing this was because I know how much people love this game, how much hype there is surrounding it, and I didn't want to be seen as that guy that just wants to rain on someone's parade. I also didn't feel like getting spammed with the usual \"git gud\" garbage but I guess you could say my playtime has given me the confidence I needed to finally put my thoughts out there. You could also say that this is just as much my own personal story with Elden Ring as it is a review of it.\n\n     I played Elden Ring a month after it came out and I'm gonna be blunt, I was not impressed by the end of my first playthrough. I didn't hate it but it was definitely my least favorite out of all the other games. I was so disappointed with my enjoyment of the game that I replayed the other games to see if I was missing something or being too harsh on the game or anything like that. I played Sekiro for the first time and fell in love with it almost immediately. I did SL1 runs of the whole trilogy to see the bosses were really as well designed as I remembered (they were). Once I was done with all that, I went back and tried a couple of different builds in Elden Ring. I really tried to break down what it was that didn't click with me. I was trying really hard to understand why I was replaying every boss in Sekiro multiple times just for fun while I couldn't be bothered to fight half of the bosses in Elden Ring again after beating them the first time.\n\n     If I were to sit here and talk about every single problem I have with this game, this shit would damn near turn into a novel so I'm gonna try to condense it as best I can. I didn't have any problems with the open world mechanics but I found the world, the lore, and the story to be far less interesting then it's predecessors. I loved the wide variety of builds with the spells and ashes of war but hated the balancing and how many of the magic types were so barebones to the point of being nonexistent (I can feel my blood pressure rising just thinking about bubble spells). I didn't like how the game felt too easy with spirit ashes but also didn't like how annoying the game was without them. I was frustrated with the performance of the game and how it always kinda ran like shit despite never being outright unplayable. I absolutely despised that no matter how good I got at fighting the bosses (getting into no hit territory), they never reached the fun level of Bloodborne, Sekiro, or DS3. Like I said, I could on and on about all the little shit for hours but I doubt anyone would care that much.\n\n     I need to make this clear, I never hated Elden Ring. I would never have gone through 1,000 hours if I outright hated it. In fact, I think one of the biggest reasons why I kept playing it so damn much was because I was trying to find that magic that everyone else was experiencing without even trying. I eventually resorted to mods (some of them even made by me) to try and just fix the problems myself. Some were more fun then others but I eventually realized that I was just setting myself up for disappointment. It's around this time that I started to change my philosophy a little. If the other games were As to high Bs for me in terms of enjoyment then I wanted to try get Elden Ring up to a B- as opposed to the C- it currently sat at with me. I accepted that Elden Ring's just never going to be my favorite but I still wanted to at least be comfortable where I stand with the game.\n\n     I wish I could describe some magical moment where everything just clicked and it instantly became my favorite game but the truth is that it was more of a soft click then a hard click. Over time, I either made my peace with or found workarounds for a lot of the things that bugged me, I grew to appreciate some of improvements Elden Ring made from it's predecessors, and I kept making more and more memories with the game. I was able to do so many things in Elden Ring with my OCs (ones that I've had as far back as Demon Souls) that I just straight up could not do in any of the other games. I lost my dad, almost lost my mom, and went through the darkest period of depression and anxiety I've ever felt and there's no denying that Elden Ring helped pull me through that time period. My opinion of the game has come a long way since my first playthrough and I think I'm finally up to that B- I mentioned earlier. It's not even close to being my favorite souls game, I still stand by all of the problems I have with the game, but I'd be lying if I told you that I regretted all the hours I spent on this game.", "timestamp_created": 1713150400, "timestamp_updated": 1713150400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162908868": {"recommendationid": "162908868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198936987632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 58892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 58891, "last_played": 1713151469}, "language": "english", "review": "crashes on launch \n\nnot buying dlc", "timestamp_created": 1713150383, "timestamp_updated": 1713150383, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162908769": {"recommendationid": "162908769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198810651214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1709, "last_played": 1712557678}, "language": "english", "review": "If only I had a bigger, but hole", "timestamp_created": 1713150235, "timestamp_updated": 1713150235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162908521": {"recommendationid": "162908521", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993366574", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 589, "playtime_at_review": 1487, "last_played": 1714278527}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1713149823, "timestamp_updated": 1713149823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162907803": {"recommendationid": "162907803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165627761", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 54749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 744, "playtime_at_review": 54020, "last_played": 1713534931}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished my first playthrough.

The story is extremely good but the star of the show is the combat. While not as good as that of Sekiro, it does have really good combat that becomes very satisfying once you get the hang of it, contrary to what some reviews say. It has a really cool kind of multiplayer where it is optional to play with others. My only complaint about this game is that it has ruined other games for me, the only other game I can still have fun in is Sekiro, every other game is just boring in comparison to Elden Ring. If you don't mind the fact that you may no longer enjoy other video games then PLEASE get Elden Ring. If you are on the fence on getting Elden Ring just get it, it is worth it, I already preordered SOTE after enjoying the game so much.

And there's so much to explore, the world really opens up and absorbs you in.

It was great indeed! Not sure if anyone wants to actually read all this, but I want to share it anyway.\n\nFrom reviews I knew that it has amazing worldbuilding that is provided in cryptic small pieces. And that the best way to play the game is to go in blind and try to figure things out by myself without any spoilers. So I did.  Played in offline mode. Did not look any information on the Internet aside from few technical things. \n\nWhat i enjoyed:  \n\n\n[h1] Non-combat [/h1]\n\n\n1. Open world freedom. After Stormveil I realized that pretty much all  of the game is optional. Do what you  want in whatever order you want. Your journey, your rules. Which is awesome as I love my games to be as non-linear as possible.    \n\n2. Cryptic exposition. I spent hours wandering around the world, trying to learn its properties and its history, so I can understand what's going on. As of now I formed my own theory about what happened and read no external theories, so it would be nice to see other perspectives. It is the first game I played where there is so little exposition, it is an incredible way to project one's own views and think hard on the themes the game offers.   \n\n3. Worldbuilding is exceptional, creative and huge. It is not just about how cryptic things are but also about how interesting the world is. And it is very interesting and full of variety. For example, it is rare to see developers to commit to weird ideas, but they did and it worked.   \n\n4. Visual design is beautiful. The game invites screenshots, and I made a ton.   \n\n5. One of the best videogames soundtracks ever. Not much to add.   \n\n6. Also it is my first From Software game, so I had the first time experience with \"lose XP on death and try to get it back\". Ingenious design that makes even high-level play tense when you carry a lot of XP on you.\n\n\n[h1] Combat [/h1]\n\n\n1. I love how you don't exactly need to level up to beat the game. With enough mastery, stamina and will you can push and beat any boss you want with pretty much no skills and no gear. It is very very hard and I personally am not ready to try it. But it is possible. And, on the other hand, if you strategize and stack odds in your favor by exploring, finding and crafting items, designing a build, you are  rewarded.   \n\n2. Ended the game on level 181, started as Astrologer, over time developed my character in a more or less well-rounded Sorceror who does not die from one hit. After finishing the game I realized it more and more that my build is awesome, but there are so many more to try out.   \n\n3. And now that I finished exploring, I can try multiplayer. Looking forward to it.  \n\n4. Beat every single boss there was to find. Boss battles in this game are great. You need to think and tailor your strategy for each one. And each has its own strong and weak sides, which may or may not correspond to strengths and weaknesses of your character. So some enemies, even supposedly tough ones, are a breeze for your build, while some, that may be considered weak, can give you a lot of trouble even on high level. \n  \n\n[h1] Criticism [/h1]\n\n\nOne strong critcism I have for Elden Ring is the design of side-quests. Just hated it. For three reasons:\n   \n1. Most quests are linear and for me it does not mesh well with an otherwise open-world, \"do what you want\" design of the overall game. You have your journey and then it all stops so a writer can push an idea he had in mind. Sure, there is a choice to not complete the quest at all, but decision on whether to lock yourself out of content or not is not exactly a good choice to make. Aside from that a player has little impact on how to complete the quest, which sucks, because I really wanted to complete some quests very differently. And had no idea why my character acts so weird.   \n\n2. Quests are cryptic. Sure, the whole game is cryptic, but when the quests are both linear and cryptic it turns completion into a search for needle in a haystack, which rubs me the wrong way. Riding all over the map, mowing down tons of enemies just to find one obscure character mentioned by another obscure character many hours ago is not fun for me personally. With a guide it would've been far easier, I guess.\n\n3. Some quests are just disagreeable and weird. I tried to roleplay as a generally benevolent character, so I saw no reason whatsoever to help obviously shady or downright evil characters to complete their quests. Especially, since the quests are mostly linear and there is usually no way to trick the NPC like you can in Fallout games, for example.\n\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\n\nCan't wait for DLC!",

As a player who have played a few of the other titles of FromSoftware, I found myself drawn into the rich game, with a challenging gameplay, and breathtaking landscapes that define this epic adventure.\r\n\r\nVisually, Elden Ring is a masterpiece. While the graphics may not be the focal point of the experience, they serve as a stunning backdrop to the game's immersive world. The open-world design is nothing short of awe-inspiring, inviting players to explore every nook and cranny at their own pace. The addition of the jumping mechanic adds a new layer of verticality to exploration, making traversing the vast landscapes feel more fluid and dynamic than ever before.\r\n\r\nOne of the standout features of Elden Ring is its horseback traversal. The ability to summon and customize your steed adds a sense of freedom to the game, allowing players to roam the open plains with ease. It's a welcome addition that complements the game's open-world design perfectly.\r\n\r\nHowever, Elden Ring is not without its flaws. While I personally enjoyed the challenge of facing off against formidable bosses, I can understand how some players might find the difficulty frustrating. Boss battles require patience, skill, and perseverance, which may not be to everyone's taste.\r\n\r\nAnother minor issue I encountered for the PC version, was with the controller support. While I recommend playing Elden Ring with a controller for the best experience, I was disappointed to find that there was no option to display PlayStation buttons for those using a PlayStation controller.

The difficulty scales inversely with how much effort you put in to exploration and learning. It's a hard game, for sure. There are tons of ways you can make it harder as well, but it's very easy to explore and get stronger and overcome those difficult fights. The game is non-linear, so you can skip to whatever parts you wish to explore as well, without fear of too many consequences. Of course, there are a few quest lines you can lock yourself out of if you jump too far ahead, but you're not likely worried about those quests if you're fighting bosses that far ahead.\n\nThe combat is smooth, the controls make sense. In a very combat-centric game such as this, that is very important. It feels good fighting and learning just when to dodge, how to attack to the best effect, and when you can pause for a breath. It's very satisfying taking down a more difficult boss with some well timed attacks and rolls, rather than beefing yourself to godlike levels.\n\nThe environments are beautifully rendered, each location being very different from the next. The scenery is gorgeous, and the sheer size of the map means there are so many beautiful vistas to find.\n\nThe characters are very colorful, and the richness of the lore is also found through exploration. You aren't spoon fed the game lore like in most RPG's, you have to look for it yourself. Flavor text in items, an off meeting with an NPC giving you hints, and even reflections of real world historical events can give context to the in-game lore. There are hundreds of hours of explanations and theories surrounding the Lands Between.\n\nIn short, didn't expect message.", "timestamp_created": 1713080926, "timestamp_updated": 1713080926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162848433": {"recommendationid": "162848433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218175815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1355, "playtime_at_review": 1999, "last_played": 1714016745}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy the Dark Souls games or soul type games in general, I would definitely recommend giving Elden Ring a try!!

wanted to wait to write a review until I was a good ways into this, and at 185 hours I'm only just getting into the endgame on my first playthrough. And with a game of this size and scope I think you really need to get pretty far into it before offering an opinion.\n\nI've played all the Souls and Soulslikes and I went into Elden Ring with expectations based on those experiences. But what I've found is that it's not really a Souls game, it's Dark Souls 3 meets Skyrim, and necessarily more Skyrim than Souls but with less structure than either of them. That's not necessarily a bad thing, there's nothing wrong with mixing genres, but I think that a lot of players will find their expectations challenged no matter which direction they're approaching it from. You could be an RPG gamer looking for an edgier Skyrim or a Souls player looking for something similar but a little less demanding. So it takes some time to get used to the unique feel of the game but beyond that initial learning curve it's a game with very broad appeal. \n\nIt's a huge open world game, and coming at it from the \"I want Dark Souls 4\" direction, I've found progression to be slow and a little confusing. I've gotten bogged down at times exploring, doing side stuff, but then that's not really any different than what I did in Witcher 3, a game I loved,  and other RPG's. I've also found that when you focus on progression the difficulty ramps up a lot, you're clearly expected to take your time poking around, killing birds for arrow feathers, checking out dungeons, and so on.\n\nIt's this mixing of genres that's the essential concept of this game. In terms of other aspects of the game like combat mechanics Elden Ring doesn't reinvent the wheel, the combat is pretty similar to what Souls players are used to going back to the first Dark Souls. It has a plot very similar to Dark Souls 3, requiring you to kill a list of bosses in a series of different areas in order to unlock the final area and final boss. What's different here is that in Dark Souls 3 the vagueness of your goal isn't problematic because you're going to be channelled along in a linear manner. But here you're just presented with a huge world and told to figure out how to accomplish your overarching goal on your own, without any direction. \n\nSo if you're a big fan of open world games and you just want to have a lot of fun roaming around, exploring, fighting a few bosses, without being pressured to get to specific goals, then Elden Ring works beautifully, And particularly if you have limited time for gaming you could happily spend months exploring the Lands Between. And players looking for a more structured experience can also have a good time here, provided you keep an overarching goal in mind and stay focused on that and as long as you have some sort of a plan for how you're going to get there. So one player may spend a lot of time dungeon crawling to get the runes(souls) needed to keep levelling and another player may just skip all of that and go farm for a while. Works both ways. \n\nAnd that's the beauty of it, it's intended to appeal to a lot of different gamers,  and it's done a very good job with that, particularly in drawing in a lot of players who haven't played a Souls game but are looking for something similar but more approachable. They clearly put a lot of thought and creativity into it and you have to admire them for what they've accomplished here. It's not a perfect game, there are problems , the various pieces don't always mesh well, but it's a unique experience, full of interesting content, and after a lot of thought I very highly recommend it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1713076650, "timestamp_updated": 1713076650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687264442443847656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162845172": {"recommendationid": "162845172", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079637323", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 894, "playtime_at_review": 2732, "last_played": 1713511227}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1713076105, "timestamp_updated": 1713076105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162844749": {"recommendationid": "162844749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869239416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10805, "last_played": 1708231729}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh, Greatsword...

ability to craft immersive worlds and challenging gameplay experiences. As a long-time fan of the Soulsborne series, I eagerly dove into the lands of the Lands Between, and I was not disappointed.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped foot into the vast and beautifully crafted world of Elden Ring, I was captivated by its sheer scale and attention to detail. The landscapes are breathtakingly diverse, from lush forests to barren deserts, each area teeming with secrets waiting to be discovered. The sense of exploration is unparalleled, with every corner of the map beckoning me to venture forth and uncover its mysteries.\n\nOf course, exploration would be nothing without the looming threat of danger, and Elden Ring delivers in spades. The combat is as challenging and satisfying as ever, requiring precision, patience, and a keen understanding of enemy patterns. Every encounter feels like a test of skill, with each victory bringing a sense of accomplishment unlike any other.\n\nBut perhaps what sets Elden Ring apart from its predecessors is its seamless integration of open-world mechanics. The addition of horseback riding and the ability to traverse the world at will adds a new layer of depth to the experience, allowing for greater freedom and immersion than ever before.\n\nOf course, no game is without its flaws, and Elden Ring is no exception. Some may find the difficulty to be off-putting, and the sheer size of the world can be overwhelming at times. However, for those willing to embrace the challenge, Elden Ring offers an experience unlike any other, one that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\n\nIn conclusion, Elden Ring is nothing short of a masterpiece. From its breathtaking world design to its challenging gameplay, it represents everything that makes FromSoftware's games so beloved by fans. Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the Soulsborne series or a newcomer looking for a challenge, Elden Ring is an adventure that should not be missed.", "timestamp_created": 1713064562, "timestamp_updated": 1713064562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162837276": {"recommendationid": "162837276", "author": {"steamid": "76561199409941583", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 288, "playtime_at_review": 3023, "last_played": 1713850704}, "language": "english", "review": "loved it when he said its elden time and started to ring all over\r\n\r\nplay it \r\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1713064457, "timestamp_updated": 1713064457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162837192": {"recommendationid": "162837192", "author": {"steamid": "76561199271398532", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 12599, "last_played": 1714164090}, "language": "english", "review": "Favourite game", "timestamp_created": 1713064326, "timestamp_updated": 1713064326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162836605": {"recommendationid": "162836605", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984607198", "num_games_owned": 1089, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7036, "last_played": 1713060960}, "language": "english", "review": "The easiest Souls game, until it isnt", "timestamp_created": 1713063504, "timestamp_updated": 1713063504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162836412": {"recommendationid": "162836412", "author": {"steamid": "76561199540932098", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 511, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1714252231}, "language": "english", "review": "New to this style of game.

Ring\" epitomizes the essence of the Soulsborne genre, offering a complex and rewarding journey that evolves from daunting to exhilarating. My personal voyage through this epic landscape was initially overshadowed by its notorious difficulty, but the game opened up significantly after navigating past the central castle area and especially once I discovered the right character build for my playstyle.\n\nThe turning point in enhancing my gameplay experience came with a strategic shift in character development\u2014particularly, allocating more stats to vitality. This adjustment made the game considerably more forgiving, allowing for extended exploration and combat endurance. The profound impact of such a simple change highlights an area where \"Elden Ring\" could improve: player guidance. For newcomers, the game's steep learning curve can be intimidating, and more accessible tutorials or resources to help players understand character building could greatly enhance the early game experience.\n\nGraphically, \"Elden Ring\" is breathtaking, with each environment and panorama painstakingly crafted. However, performance issues in the later stages suggest a need for better optimization to maintain immersion without technical distractions.\n\nThe mythos of rising from a peasant to an Elden Lord is compelling, brilliantly integrating the theme of ascending to godhood as you grow in power. This narrative framework provides a rich backdrop that makes each player's progression feel significant and earned. Despite this, the game's conclusion can feel somewhat underwhelming, as it doesn't radically alter the world or reflect the monumental journey that led to it\u2014a common critique in many open-world games.\n\nAdditionally, my experience was significantly enhanced by modifications I implemented myself, such as adjusting the game to run at 120 fps and enabling unlimited respec options. These modifications suggest that such features would be beneficial if included natively within the game, as they address fundamental aspects of gameplay fluidity and flexibility that can enhance player satisfaction.\n\nAs I anticipate the expansion \"Shadow of the Erdtree,\" I reflect on \"Elden Ring\" as a landmark in gaming. It's a title that offers a profound, if sometimes perplexing, adventure that challenges players to explore, adapt, and conquer. The game stands as a pillar of the genre, offering a journey that is as rewarding as it is demanding, and continues to captivate with its promise of further expansions and enhancements.", "timestamp_created": 1713045119, "timestamp_updated": 1713045370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162823436": {"recommendationid": "162823436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340163405", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2428, "last_played": 1710125235}, "language": "english", "review": "Miyazaki you've done it again", "timestamp_created": 1713045081, "timestamp_updated": 1713045081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467032968997955322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162823326": {"recommendationid": "162823326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277510306", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1230, "playtime_at_review": 12230, "last_played": 1713357916}, "language": "english", "review": "God I need scarlet rotussy\n\nI never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Malenia, Goddess of Rot.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I have never played a souls game. I've always been deterred by the very vocal souls players with how much they brag and obsess about difficulty. \r\n\r\nHowever, I originally got this game because of I was looking for an open world game that didn't have the ubisoft gps tracker., minimap and objectives where it spoon feeds you everything. Another reason was I got a taste of souls combat from Code Vein because its frequently on sale and cheap and thought had nothing to lose. I did enjoy souls combat but felt it was too linear and pigeonholed me into playing a certain way. \r\n\r\nElden Ring is a great game to durdle with. I often joke with my friend call the game Durdle Ring. The first 50 hours was me durdling around finding random cool gear or finding cool settings and taking in the atmosphere. The set design of the game is really well done. It was a breath of fresh area compared to open world games which handhold you in exploration.\r\n\r\nDurdling also included exploring which playstyle fit me. I learned early on Im bad at melee combat, I panic too much and struggle to be close enough to an enemy to hit itwith a sword. But there are several ranged playstyles I found that fit my tendency to panic when being attacked and was viable enough to bring me to completing a playthrough. \r\n\r\nWhats great is that there are enough tools to help the player overcome bosses from weapons, skills, gear, summons, and co-op which helped relieve how daunting the game felt. \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1713022833, "timestamp_updated": 1713022833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162801230": {"recommendationid": "162801230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292685984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28296, "last_played": 1712648456}, "language": "english", "review": "Fia best girl", "timestamp_created": 1713022825, "timestamp_updated": 1713022825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162799803": {"recommendationid": "162799803", "author": {"steamid": "76561199510096159", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 348, "playtime_at_review": 8496, "last_played": 1713380090}, "language": "english", "review": "it was perfect.

The bosses are fun, challenging, and always satisfying to beat. With such a wide variety of content to explore, it is very difficult to run out of things to do. It's why I have so many hours in this game: I never got bored of it.\n\nMy main criticism come more from personal experience rather than concepts the game has. Notably, the world feels smaller when you learn where everything is and avoid places to fight bosses or get items you don't need. This is to be expected as with other entries to the franchise, the experience feels linear and shorter with each playthrough. Despite this, I am still amazed at this beautiful world each time I ride through it.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and try this game. It is difficult, punishing at times, but the immense satisfaction and relief from beating a boss you've been stuck on for 5 hours never fails to make the mood better.

it.\n\nIf you're new to them, imagine the following: You're in a dark medieval fantasy world, armed with some basic gear, and 95% of the world wants to kill you on sight. You're not the protagonist who is destined to save the world, you're just some nameless NPC. \nNow imagine you go out and try to defeat those enemies. Maybe you get a few of them, but inevitably, you die to something. A boss, or an unexpected powerful enemy, or fall damage.\nAnd you get up, and try again. But this time, you're a bit better.\nYou still fail again, but now you've learned something new about one of the enemies.\nOn the third try, you make it further. A terrible monster destroys you.\nYou get back up again. And this time, you succeed. \nYou find a safe place, and take a breather. Bit by bit, you find new items. You level up. \nYou're stronger now. But not only that, your timing has gotten better. \nThree days later.\nYou're in a new place, one filled with even worse enemies, and a swamp that poisons you. There's a message on the ground from a fellow player. \"I want to go home,\" it reads. You sympathize. Me too, buddy. You cross the swamp and see another message from some poor soul. \"Be wary of right,\" it says. You creep toward the next corner, and spot an enemy waiting in ambush. You defeat it easily and give kudos to the other player's message.\nThe other player is in the middle of a heated boss battle, and they're out of heals. They're dodging frantically, and suddenly, your kudos gives them a free heal. They go on to defeat the boss, thanks to your anonymous help.\n\nThese are the kinds of moments that await you in this game. It's full of struggle, tragedy and triumph. If you're new, use everything at your disposal, because the game doesn't pull punches. Look up guides, find useful weapons on the wiki. Do whatever it takes to win. Don't let anyone tell you that you're playing it wrong.\n\nElden Ring was the first time I fell in love with a Soulsborne game, and it has since convinced me to go back and play others, especially Dark Souls 3.\n\nGood luck.

A lot of them are straight up garbage. Most of the boss mechanics are beyond trash and frustating. The things that I love about this game is the story, the world building, and level design of this game. I love it a lot and that is the only reason why am giving it thumbs up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bosses in this game are some of the most frustrating bosses I have ever dealt with compared to something like WoW, FFXIV, and even DS3 (first 13 hours). I don't have I single boss that I actually liked in this entire game because you have to redo the entire battle knowing that it may be few attempts or you just summon someone to help you. Especially the last boss Elden Beast was the only boss I had to actually summon someone to help me with due to mimic not being good enough to make it second phase. I will say I got the Elden Beast to 12% and that I was why I summon a player.\r\n\r\nThe world design is just amazing. I loved every second of exploring the world. It the only reason why I put this many hours into this game. I love going everywhere and looking at things. The problem is that it was never rewarding, but seeing lore I guess was sort of rewarding. I only two weapon this entire game the starter weapon for samurai and River of Blood. I loved the River of Blood since it was my type of play style of just messing up the mobs.\r\n\r\nThe story is was decent and I enjoy it a lot. I personally went with Ranni Age of Star since was the only ending that I liked personally. I just wish there was more world building and world changing element, but that just not a Fromsoftware type of thing since they care more about combat and game design which isn't a bad thing until they completely screw it up in Elden Ring.\r\n\r\n6/10 is my final score. Cannot wait to rage at more fromsoftware game.", "timestamp_created": 1712907670, "timestamp_updated": 1712907670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

The Lands Between sprawls before you, a vast and intricate artifact of lore, history, and mystery waiting to be unraveled. Every crumbling ruin, every tangled forest, every desolate battlefield is infused with a sense of place and purpose, inviting exploration and discovery at every turn.\nBut what truly sets Elden Ring apart is its unparalleled sense of freedom. In a genre often plagued by linear storytelling and rigid progression,  FromSoftware has shattered the mold, offering players an open world of staggering scope and depth. Whether scaling towering mountains or delving into the darkest depths of underground catacombs, the sense of agency is palpable, empowering players to forge their own path and shape their own destiny.\nOf course, such freedom would be meaningless without meaningful gameplay to accompany it, and Elden Ring delivers in spades. Combat is a symphony of steel and sorcery, demanding precision, timing, and strategy. Every encounter is a test of skill, pushing players to their limits and rewarding mastery with a sense of satisfaction unlike any other.\nBut perhaps most remarkable of all is Elden Ring's ability to weave its gameplay and narrative together into a seamless tapestry. Every boss slain, every quest completed, every secret uncovered feels like a piece of a larger puzzle, driving the story forward and deepening the player's connection to the world and its inhabitants.\nIn the end, Elden Ring isn't just a game; it's a masterpiece. A towering achievement that sets a new standard for all of gaming, and reaffirms FromSoftware's status as one of the greatest developers of our time. Whether you're a fan of action RPGs or simply appreciate storytelling and lore in games, Elden Ring is an experience not to be missed.\n", "timestamp_created": 1712870992, "timestamp_updated":

Time. I still watch content about that game today and have gone back and played it a couple times. No game has ever made me feel the same way I do about Ocarina of TIme, but then Elden Ring came along. This is easily one of the best games ever made to date in my opinion. So many countless playthroughs always differing and finding new things you didn't find before. There is a seamless coop mod that makes playing with friends much more enjoyable but playing this game alone is a wonderful time as well. You find yourself getting sucked in and immersed in the scenery and enviorments. This is one of those games that you say youll just sit down and play for an hour or so but then you realize you played the entire day away and had a blast doing it. Even when you are stuck at some frustrating ass boss theres something about it that doesnt make you feel like youve hit a major wall. Maybe its that its open world and if your stuck you can go explore and get stronger and come back later. Torrent is a little sensitive when trying to turn back and forth on him but other than that he controls amazingly. So many different armor sets and weapons and the armor sets can even offer their own buffs to you for wearing it. You can even choose to have summons on your side to help and they do help tremendously. However if your a souls vet played and beat dark souls 3, bloodborne, sekiro etc any of the other soulsborne games than more than likely having summons with you will make the game to easy. Without summons this game is quite difficult honestly, even with summons some fights can just be made \r\nharder by them. However you want to play this game has a build for you with an adventure curated just for you on that playthrough.

I was afraid I would rage quit and wouldn't enjoy it but the more I played the more it grew on me. I was fascinated by the world sure the enemies were hard and sure I died plenty of times but something kept pushing me forward to not give up. There were moments of anger, frustration but also moments of beauty, and grace. Every boss has its challenges. I kept going with every new area I explored I got stronger with every defeat I learned and adapted. It's not an easy game but if you have patience, determination, and will you can learn to be great. A friend once told me \"The game is only as hard as you make it.\" I couldn't have put it better myself. I loved this game a lot and I highly enjoyed covering it on YouTube with my community. I had no idea what to expect and that's what made it awesome. If anyone is afraid to cover this game or has no previous Souls experience like me this is one experience that will truly change your life. It will challenge the way you think, the way you usually play, and the way you experience games forever.

But as someone who played DS1 and DS3 (casually), boss design other than Margit is horrible (still yet to fight Melania and Radagon but I'm nearly finished w the game so even if they turn out to be good, not enough to change my view). The game pushes you to use summons and magic against bosses in many instances through either spawning some difficult NPCs or spamming attacks/abilities (i.e Commander Niall, Draconic Tree Sentinel, Mirriam).\n\nFall damage is bad: it feels like one jump kills you and torrent while another only takes away a bit.

I've tried it again, again and again and it just never clicks for me. \nI've tried to validate my feelings by watching lots of review content and replaying older FromSoftware games. \n\nFor the games defense, it got lots of good in it.  It looks great, the world design and monsters etc. are spot on.\nThe weapons and combat mechanics and different items you can collect to aid you in combat keep the game interesting. I had lots of fun exploring some of the side content in the game.\n\nMy major issue with the game is the bosses. Most of the time they are not fun. Most of them punish you too hard from one mistake and barely give you any time to counter attacks. I didn't like cheese bosses from previous FromSoftware titles but this time I feel like they've overdone it. \n\nAnother thing I don't like is that this game isn't great for going in \"blind\". You'll have bad time without meta builds or guides to find \"the good stuff\". The game is way too big to not give any directions at all and it's easy to feel just exhausted and not wanting to explore at all. It doesn't really help that lots of content (including mini bosses) are copy-paste content. \n\nIf you are not a speed runner and know all the tricks beforehand, you'll find yourself quite fast being stuck on boss that keeps one-shotting you for hours, days, weeks. \n\nI'm at that point of the game where I've explored the game enough and I want to \"wrap it up\" but I can't finish it because I'm stuck on a stupid anime style boss that is way too fast for the player character. \n\nWhy I did give it thumbs up?

Your character will react 0.25 seconds after you press the dodge button, even if you push it quickly.\n\nThis lousy mechanic will destroy all your reactions in other games. You think you become better in other games when you play Souls games, but in reality, you become worse. \n\nSouls games like Elden Ring give you stupid reactions, like having to roll into a monster instead of rolling from it.\n\nElden Ring has invincibility frames, which only exist in Souls games. So you will only be good at this kind of game with a messed up controller, and if you do not become crazy about the clunky bad controller like me, then go ahead.\n\nPeople who say git gud defend a terrible control. No action games except Souls games have this kind of delay, and that is because the devs have done this on purpose to make the game harder. In reality, you trick yourself into believing you will be better at games playing this crap. Every time I play Dragon's Dogma or a game where the controller works and return to these crappy genres called Souls games, I have to learn EVERYTHING again from scratch. Just skip these bad games and focus on games where the controller works.\n\n\nFor those who do not believe this, search YouTube for Elden Ring delayed dodge and see for yourself. This review is not a lie like the Souls fans does.\n\n\nSo why have I given this a thumbs-up? It's because of a YouTuber named \nThingfishy \"How To Dodge-Roll - In-Depth Beginner Guide - Elden Ring\"\nThat is the search words to find his guide.\n\nThe delayed dodge can be worked around, but it demands a different view. It is still a bad design; you can make it way better, but Fromsoft seems to be not that good at programming. \n\nIf you learn the mechanic he teaches, you can enjoy the game even with the delayed dodge.", "timestamp_created": 1712656272, "timestamp_updated": 1713145403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422174841165542603", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162531836": {"recommendationid": "162531836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158442596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1116, "playtime_at_review": 4072, "last_played": 1714252139}, "language": "english", "review": "A truly amazing game like its predecessors (Dark Souls).

Disclaimer: !!![/u]\nThis Review is written before the completion of my first ever playthrough of Elden Ring, so I might edit it later and/ or add a few things that were relevant enough for me to add them as I play through the game a few different ways.\n\nThis Review will be divided into several categories and rated on ?/10.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst up, we got [b][u]The world and its design[/u][/b] (8/10):\n\nThe world is beautifully designed, theres many different areas with a wide variety of enemies and minibosses for extra bossitems and/ or useable spells. Many different merchants can be found, caves with bosses to face after finishing exploring them and so called \"Churches of Merika\" with inhabiting NPCs or items to upgrade ur Estus. The whole map itself is gigantic and must be diclosed by finding map items, which can be found in the associated area. \n\nFor me personally, it was very easy to get lost in the open world, especially since I was used to the Dark Souls games and its rather linear progression system, which lead me to miss out on quite a few minibosses and talismans, not to mention NPCs and their associated questline. So taking all of that into account, I rate the overall world design an 8/10!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext, we will take a look at [b][u]The Lore [/u][/b] (7/10?):\n\nI wont get too much into The Lore as to not give away too much about the game, but I was rather intrigued by the cinematic intro. Since I am not a person that gets into the Lore of every game and reads every single item description in order to find out more about whats going on in the game, I can't say for sure what I would rate the lore in context of the other [i]Soulsborne Games [/i]. So I would go with a 7/10(?). \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next and final section of my review with revolve around [b][u]The Bosses and their design[/u][/b], aswell as [b][u]The combat system in general[/u][/b] (10/10, second best I have ever gotten to experience in a [i]Soulsborne game[/i], right after the Bloodborne combat system!): \n\nOkay, I have [b]alot[/b] to say about [i]Elden Ring's [/i] combat system, so bare with me please! First off, the bosses, their movesets and [b]MOST OF ALL! [/b] their voicelines far surpassed the expectations I had towards this game and are EASILY the single best designed in the entire franchise! \n\nThere are bosses that use [i]Dexterity focused weapons[/i], leading to a moveset that consists of combos that can lead into a flurry of attacks, simply melting your HP down to 0, whereas there are other foes, that have delayed attacks that require you to adapt to their timing. They are quite slow and do not have many tools in their arsenal to dispose of you [u]Lowly tarnished[/u], but they hit like a truck, should you be too slow to get out of their way and dodge effectively! That type of boss trusts in their [i]Strength[/i], in order to hinder you to progress through the lands between. \n\nThe arenas, some bosses can be located and challenged in, may take your breat away simply by how beautifully and fitting they are designed, complimenting their respective boss snd/or area they are located in. BUT FOCUS ON THE TARGET INFRONT OF YOU!\n\nYou yourself have many different tools at your disposal in order to reach your goal, with many different paths and classes to choose from. Crafting is a mechanic that debuts in this game, with crafting materias scattered about for you to collect and use to your advantage and give you a slightly bigger chance of beating the opponent you might get stuck on along your journey. \n\nAs I mentioned above, I NEED to give the combat system a perfect rating! But I also said, it was the second best combat system I have experienced so far, right after Bloodborne's. Elden ring is a masterpiece, but I can simply not find the strength to push Bloodborne off of the throne, that is my heart and let Elden Ring take its spot...! I am howeveer curious, wether the DLC might change that fact, so stay tuned, maybe I will upate my Review after playing through the DLC.\n\nUntil then, I higly recommend this game as an entrypoint to the [i]Soulsborne Series[/i]. \n\nPay the maiden your respects after rating my review, thank you and have a nice day/ night\n\n[h2]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3207137551[/h2]", "timestamp_created": 1712607053, "timestamp_updated": 1712607364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539695262908935547", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162501607": {"recommendationid": "162501607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198963508773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8756, "last_played": 1712642190}, "language": "english", "review": "I hadn't played a souls-borne game before this.

The open world exploring is S tier and the story ingrained into each character is amazing. 634 hours into this game and I am still finding new things. Let's get down to the specifics though\r\n\r\n1. SOUNDS:\r\n     The soundtrack is, of course, amazing and fits perfectly with any boss fight or combat in the open world.\r\n     Breaking an enemy's stance is so satisfying.\r\n     Critical striking an enemy feels so powerful. The list goes on because this game is thoroughly fleshed out.\r\n2. BOSS FIGHTS\r\n     \"BLADE OF MIQUELLA\" tough... but wonderful if you are a masochist.\r\n     These boss fights are some of the most fun and challenging boss fights I have had in a long time.\r\n     As I said earlier, the soundtrack to each boss is amazing and made to fit the lore of each boss.\r\n     When you finally kill a boss you feel so powerful! All up until the easiest npc in the game kills you. \r\n     The move sets of almost all of the bosses are really cool in my opinion. \r\n3. GENERAL COMBAT\r\n    Melee combat is at it's peak here. Strategy is a must for the whole game. One mistimed dodge or swing of your weapon could erase the souls your Tarnished vessel tried so valiantly to retrieve. \r\n    The weapon designs and skills are so much fun. The variety of weapon designs and skills allow for not just overpowering some enemies, but they are also easy to cosplay with. \r\n4. MAGIC\r\n    I am mostly a tank, damage, and support kind of player so I get some could use out of the support/ buffing spells and incantations. \r\n    One critique I have is, I do not get nearly the same satisfaction from using damage spells as I  do with a melee weapon. I just feel that the spells are lacking in someway and that could very well just be a me problem.\r\n5. TERRAIN: \r\n     The locations in and around the Lands Between are beautifully depicted. The trees in Leyndell, the different cultures ingrained into the buildings around the map, the star lit sky of Siofra River and Nokron, everything in this game has so much passion placed into it. \r\n 6. SUMMARY\r\n     I love this game! I suggest it to anyone I know that has an interest in video games. Currently I am cosplaying Varre. Two Great Knives in hand and plenty of bleed and the blood spells of Mohg. This is probably my favorite cosplay so far. Extremely fun. The variety in ways you can tackle this game really makes it my favorite game by a large margin. \r\n\r\n    BECOME A TARNISHED! JOIN US AND COMMIT THE CARDINAL SIN! OR BETTER YET, BRING CHAOS TO CONSUME THE WORLD!\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1712596562, "timestamp_updated": 1712596562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

You don't instantly know what to do, you have to take your time, explore and learn which adds to the open world adventure feel. The bosses so far vary, from being quite easy to seeming impossible (AT FIRST) but then after dying over and over and trying to remember their attack patterns, timing etc you finally master them and beat it like a piece of cake and you find yourself shaking in relief but also achievement after completion on the mini milestone.

Not that I hate it, only that it fails to make me want to play it more. I would recommend literally any of the other Souls games over this one 90% of the time. I am not saying this game is bad, only that I would recommend playing literally all the other souls games first. Leaving this one as the \"I have no other Soulsborn games left to play\" option. I feel like those games are more cohesive experiences that are far more focused in their design than Elden Ring.\r\n\r\nI can play the older games any time I want without feeling lost or frustrated. If I want to play Elden Ring I am stuck playing the same handful of meta builds or risk making the game pure frustration. If I want to not lose track of what I was doing, I can't go to long without playing or I forget what I was doing or where I was in a quest line. There is a reason the open worlds this game is supposedly better than, use checklists and quest logs. Because there is to much stuff that without them you would lose track of it all. Checklists are not inherently a bad thing. But I'm not a smart enough person to fully elaborate on the nuance of that statement. No. Sadly I'm a dummy.\r\n\r\nBut a big part of what I think the problem is comes down to the game's big open world. Outside of a few exceptions it is very forgettable. A blending of the typical environments you expect to see in a souls game, only with the endless repetition of a generic open world. The best areas of the game are the ones with a much smaller scale. Like the legacy dungeons or the smaller open sections like Siofra River or Nokron. Open, but more structured like the classic games. These places make all the repetitive little side activities feel so out of place. They feel straight out of the generic open world playbook. Just because they are not marked on your map as a checklist doesn't mean they aren't generic copy paste busy work. These side activities designed to pad out playtime and create the illusion of extra content. \r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between fighting a unique boss, enjoying it, and fighting it again either by putting down a summon sign to help another player, or just fighting it again NG+  compared to fighting the same boss 3 times in 2 different dungeons and 1 time in an evergaol? Some trinkets at the end of each dungeon? Some trinkets that could have just as easily been sprinkled through the legacy dungeons in more densely packed interconnected secrets. You know, like the souls games were well loved for in the first place?\r\n\r\nHalf the, crypts, evergaols and mines could have been cut with no loss to the game's feel. Removing them might have even made the game feel better instead of padded with pointless busy work. They look the same, they feel the same, and all their bosses are copy pasted the same. None of it feels special anymore. Worse than that they rob other moments that might have been special of the chance to be special. I'm certain I'm not alone in seeing a boss in a crypt or evergaol, or even just as an open world boss. Then fighting them thinking that was a pretty mid boss, then seeing where I was supposed to encounter that boss for the first time and the \"Wow factor\" of that moment was ruined by previously encountering them as a generic boss. Open world doesn't mean better. It just means a lot of empty connecting space, with a need to fill it somehow. And what they filled that space with is copy pasted and generic. \r\n\r\nMoving from one topic to another, as I don't want to get hung up on one point for to long; I haven't even begun to talk about some of the games most notorious difficulty spikes. Though honestly I don't plan to. People smarter than me with more skill than me have made far more compelling arguments for and against the difficulty than I ever could. To the point that my voice wont lend anything constructive to the conversation. All I will say is that I never could beat Melenia. And at this point, I don't care. I don't need to give myself the headache trying when the reward for beating her isn't worth it. Especially since half the game's community seems to mock katana weapons as noob crutches. Despite us having had over a decade with this format of game some still can't seem to just let people play the way they want to without having to make a fuss about it. And yes I know mimic tear bends her over its knee. But I want to beat the boss. Not watch the AI do it. If you want to just call it a \"skill issue\"? Fine, I don't care. My sanity is worth far more than an imaginary video gamer e-peen, that no matter how big you think yours is, still wont get you any maidens.\r\n\r\nAll in all I am left feeling very much confused. Because on the surface I should love this game for being just \"Bigger Dark Souls.\" But I don't. Maybe if they removed all the copy paste boss encounters that rob each unique fight of their memorability. Maybe if they focused more on the legacy dungeons that felt like fun and worthwhile challenges of exploration rather than just big open space, each location would feel more memorable. Maybe if they spent less time worrying about making the game hard for experienced players and just made it on par with previous titles, the meta wouldn't be so restrictive. Maybe if all these things had come to be I wouldn't have ever even cared enough to try and put my thoughts to text, and I would have just put another 200+ hours in without a second thought to the YES/NO recommendation button.\r\n\r\nI wanted to love this game. I wanted to love it so much. But I am left disappointed. I see Elden ring as a good game. But one that had it just a little more restraint would have been infinitely more enjoyable for me. But it seems like it has lost focus on what originally drew players like me to these games in the first place. All in favor of the mass appeal that the open world tag seems to draw in. So with that we get to the ultimate YES/NO decision I had to make. I don't like the generic \"YES/NO\" review system on steam. So I try to answer it with an entirely personal question. Since I know I can only ever speak for myself. \r\n\r\nI ask myself, \"If I were talking to my past self would I recommend the game to me? Or would I just like my time back?\". Then hit YES or NO based on that. Not as some objective statement to the game's quality. It wasn't an easy decision to come to. I didn't enjoy my time with this game. No matter how many hours I sat through trying to tell myself that I did. Or that it just wasn't clicking with me yet. If you loved it, than all I can say is that I wish I felt the way you did. Maybe someday, I'll come back to it and my thoughts will be different. But until then. Have fun playing the games you love. And never let anyone tell you that they way you feel about a game is \"Wrong\".", "timestamp_created": 1712463747, "timestamp_updated": 1712463747, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478381842374801636", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162385832": {"recommendationid": "162385832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043916186", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 26396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26396, "last_played": 1708896894}, "language": "english", "review": "This is currently the greatest game of all time.

Haven't played other souls-like games except for Dark Souls 2 so can't really compare it to those but as a souls-like beginner I'd highly recommend it. Only issue I had was open world, but after my first walk-trough I've learnt most of it even tho it's huge. It's just so good that every location just stuck with me. For beginners I'd recommend using wiki to navigate trough the game but I'd highly recommend trying to avoid spoilers on bosses and such, just use the map for \"level progression\" so you don't enter locations where enemies will shred you cuz of your low level. I'm pretty sure one walk-trough will be enough to memorize most of the game and for new builds you will more then likely know where to go when without any big issues. Also, if you are not satisfied with your build and you find a new more interesting weapon, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO RESPEC. You can respec and redo your build mid game without any repercussions so if you wanna try out new stuff, then do it!\r\nLove this game and can't wait for the new DLC, I've got nothing to complain about! <3", "timestamp_created": 1712347602, "timestamp_updated": 1712347602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162284146": {"recommendationid": "162284146", "author": {"steamid": "76561199224397168", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "playtime_at_review": 5622, "last_played": 1714004266}, "language": "english", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1712347155, "timestamp_updated": 1712347155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162284115": {"recommendationid": "162284115", "author": {"steamid": "76561199364377482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 349, "playtime_at_review": 1740, "last_played": 1714268233}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game with rich content and never ending exploration.", "timestamp_created": 1712347126, "timestamp_updated": 1712347126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162283539": {"recommendationid": "162283539", "author": {"steamid": "76561199103549152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 534, "playtime_at_review": 1041, "last_played": 1713811812}, "language": "english", "review": "Suffering, Sufferin, And then uhm..More Suffering.", "timestamp_created": 1712346555, "timestamp_updated": 1712346555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162283070": {"recommendationid": "162283070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010040300", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 10988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 350, "playtime_at_review": 8989, "last_played": 1713812420}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me two years to beat on and off.

From the rhythmic chug of the locomotives to the distant wail of the whistle, there was nothing Tommy loved more than the sleek metal beasts that raced along the tracks.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tommy harbored a deep-seated fear, one that lurked in the shadows of his otherwise joyful existence \u2014 spiders. Ever since he was a child, the sight of their hairy legs and beady eyes sent shivers down his spine, filling him with an unshakeable sense of dread.\r\n\r\nOne fateful evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and darkness descended upon the town, Tommy's parents left him alone in their cozy cottage while they attended to urgent matters in the neighboring village. Despite his unease at being left alone, Tommy found solace in the familiar sound of the distant train whistle echoing through the night.\r\n\r\nAs he sat by the window, his gaze fixed upon the tracks that snaked through the countryside, Tommy's heart leaped with excitement at the approaching train. But as the familiar rumble grew louder, his joy turned to terror as he spotted something unsettling lurking in the shadows.\r\n\r\nA dark figure, with eight spindly legs and glistening eyes, scuttled along the tracks, its presence sending a chill down Tommy's spine. Paralyzed with fear, he watched in horror as the creature drew closer, its movements fluid and sinister in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nDesperate to escape the nightmare unfolding before him, Tommy frantically searched for a place to hide. With trembling hands, he barricaded himself in the attic, his heart pounding in his chest as the sounds of the approaching train mingled with the haunting echo of the creature's footsteps.\r\n\r\nAs the train thundered past, its blaring whistle drowning out the cacophony of Tommy's racing thoughts, he dared to peek through the dusty windowpane, hoping against hope that the nightmare had passed.\r\n\r\nBut to his horror, the creature remained, its malevolent gaze fixed upon him with a hunger that sent shivers down his spine. With each passing moment, it drew closer, its shadowy form growing larger and more menacing with every step.\r\n\r\nJust as all hope seemed lost, a blinding light pierced the darkness, illuminating the attic with a brilliance that banished the creature back into the night. And there, standing in the doorway, was Tommy's father, his worried expression softened by relief as he gathered his trembling son in his arms.\r\n\r\nIn the safety of his father's embrace, Tommy's fear slowly began to fade, replaced by a sense of gratitude for the love and protection that surrounded him. And though the memory of that fateful night would linger in his nightmares for years to come, Tommy found solace in the knowledge that no matter how terrifying the darkness may seem, the light of love would always guide him home.", "timestamp_created": 1712329897, "timestamp_updated": 1712329897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162265751": {"recommendationid": "162265751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024694009", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 343, "playtime_at_review": 4616, "last_played": 1713647558}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game to play with a friend, that forces the play to be a of a set skill level individually to progress past certain points which I respect.

copy and paste, this is worse than all the copy and paste in Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. FromSoftware clearly absolutely hates doing work, this is a $19.99 rehash of DarkSouls-3 in a bigger map that gaslights into believing it doesn't copy and paste the same shack model 5 times before you get out of the starting zone.\n\nI'm likely seeing it even worse since I just came off a binge through Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 - but the only original content is the boss fights. Every single animation is from one of the older games, every single weapon art is just a remap of an enemy attack to the player. Bosses like Leonine Misbegotten are also mostly just Bloodborne animations reused.\n\nUp to Liurnia I've seen only 2 different shack models and have counted 16 unique ruin wall pieces and only 2 different kinds of towers. Every Tunnels dungeon map uses the same handful of pieces and all have the same boss-room. Only one of the caves uses a different boss room, but that's because it's a thru cave to the dragon covenant isle.\n\nSure, the gameplay is mostly fine but it's impossible to overlook how puffed and inflated the content is. Liurnia doesn't need to be even a quarter the size it is, it's literally just flat puff. \n\nThe game relies too much on some sudden burst damage coming out of combos so you're doing a pittance of damage and then all of sudden BAM! 1/3rd the enemy's HP goes away and it dies. That makes it difficult to judge if you should even be engaging an enemy or not as you cannot tell how hard you actually hit until the burst occurs (praise optimal level maps on wikis). Usual souls' game issues that disengagement is an RNG chance affair, so don't get roped into melee if you don't want to start a damage cheese race as you can roll some dice on whether you can get disengage or just get killed for trying. Attack tracking and variable length holding has been reasonable, I haven't actually noticed any enemies doing DS3 nonsense of holding their chambered swings for varying lengths of time.\n\nTL;DR: only buy this on sale, it's not worth $59.99 usd, not even close.\n\nDo not feel bad about murdering innocent birds. You will come to the conclusion that birds must be erased from the world.", "timestamp_created": 1712253145, "timestamp_updated": 1712254090, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 5,

is, frankly, just there. Amidst a sea of games clamoring for attention, it exists, steadfastly occupying its own space, I suppose. This review endeavors to dissect the game in a manner as colorlessly precise as possible, without swaying too far towards any form of excitement or disapproval.\n\n[h2]Gameplay Mechanics[/h2]\n\nThe core gameplay of Elden Ring, as one might expect, involves a series of actions, quests, and battles. There is a certain level of complexity to the combat system, offering a variety of weapons and spells for players to use. Movement through the game world is facilitated by walking, running, and the use of a mount. These elements function in a way that allows you to interact with the game, which is about as much as one can say on the matter. The mechanics are there, they work, and I suppose that's an important aspect of being a game.\n\n[h2]Visual and Auditory Experience[/h2]\n\nVisually, Elden Ring presents a vast world filled with diverse landscapes, characters, and creatures. The graphics do their job, rendering the game's environment in a manner that can be seen with the eyes. The sound design accompanies these visuals, providing auditory cues and a soundtrack that exists alongside the visual components. It's all very much a part of the game, and to be frank, it doesn't evoke much beyond that basic acknowledgment.\n\n[h2]Narrative and World Building[/h2]\n\nThe narrative of Elden Ring, along with its world-building, is present. There's a story being told within a universe that has been crafted with a certain level of detail. Characters and lore fill the game, offering information and context for those inclined to explore it. Whether these elements are compelling or merely exist as part of the game's structure is a matter of perspective, I guess. They're there if you want to delve into them, but I'm not sure how much they'll impact your overall experience.\n\n[h2]Overall Impression[/h2]\n\nTo encapsulate the experience of playing Elden Ring on PC in a few words, one might describe it as 'playing a game.' It's an experience that, while functional and comprehensive in its scope, maintains a steadfast commitment to neutrality in its execution. The game does what it sets out to do, offering a gameplay experience that exists and continues to exist as long as you choose to engage with it. In conclusion, Elden Ring is a game available for play on the PC, offering a mixture of combat, exploration, and story that collectively forms a cohesive gaming experience. It is a title that will occupy time and, perhaps, space on your hard drive. To those considering whether to embark on this journey, it may be wise to abstain, safeguarding oneself from the risk of encountering an overwhelmingly average experience that could potentially unsettle one's commitment to polar rating systems.", "timestamp_created": 1712224000, "timestamp_updated": 1712224000, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424561411142349243", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162173895": {"recommendationid": "162173895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198446780572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1504, "playtime_at_review": 7279, "last_played": 1714311574}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone completely new to the Souls-like genre, delving into Elden Ring was an experience beyond expectations.

If you like games like Bloodborne, Sekiro, Dark Souls, then you are going to love this one. Keep in mind that it can be difficult. The map is HUGE, huge variety of things to loot and craft, a ton of unique weapons, and a HUGE variety of dark twisted mind blowing enemies to slay. I also like writing and reading messages that other players left, seeing players in the world every once in awhile, and seeing bloodstains where other players have previously died which warns me of the dangers. I always thought these were unique mechanics.\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\nMy only complaint is the way Co-op is handled. Co-Op is the same as in Bloodborne. You would think this would be fixed after all of the complaints after Bloodborne. The issue with this, is that it is sometime hard to call people in to help you with a boss. Sometimes you will be sitting there waiting ten minutes for a gold mark to pop up on the floor. When it finally does, you sometimes get invaded by a player. Sometimes that player is a OP try hard and they completely destroy you and the person you summoned and the session ends. Now you have to go and wait for the gold mark again, when all you wanted was help with the boss. There should be an option that allows you to turn off invasions altogether instead of forcing players to play PVP every time you ask other players for help. To make matters worse, you have to craft something called a \"Furlcalling Finger Remedy\" in order to play with friends or get help from other players. So if you die, you not only have to wait for another gold seal to pop up, but you have to craft these every single time. They are easy to craft but it is still a headache. Especially when you want to play with your friends and it kicks them every time you die and forces you to go through this entire process again. The Co-Op is just a little bit of a nuisance and needs work. \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nThese cons don't break the game in anyway! Its still an amazing game overall. I would still give it 10/10 even with these flaws! I would definitely buy it again for full price. Don't think about it, just buy it. It's well worth the $60 price tag. You won't be disappointed. I have 129 hours into this game and I am not near close to being done. I am blown away by how long it is. (That's what she said)\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1712221423, "timestamp_updated": 1712221423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988",

The location and enemy variety kept me excited, looking forward to what the next area will look like and what type of fucked-up enemy Miyazaki has concocted. There are major secret areas and mini dungeons that can be found just by exploring in the open world, and once you get hooked on finding them, six hours will have passed and the deadline for your schoolwork will have already passed too. I spent 20 hours just exploring the whole of Limgrave (the starting area) because I found a dungeon somewhere. This game will really make you say, \"What the hell is that?\" throughout your journey, then get you distracted by seven different things on the way, and I freaking love it that the world holds secrets and really feels alive and breathing.\n\nThe highlight of this game for me, though, as an action RPG and Souls fan, is the combat and bosses, and I'm really happy with the quality of the Remembrance bosses. All of them have really interesting design, voice acting, music, lore, and movesets, that I really wish for Elden Ring to have a system where you can fight bosses again, similar to the Reflection of Strength from Sekiro. All of the Remembrance bosses feel and fight like final bosses in other games but in a cinematic way especially the last few gauntlet of bosses in the endgame. Of course, they're not perfect, and some have attacks that really feel unfair [spoiler](most notably Maliketh's Edgelord attacks and Elden Beast's Elden Stars and the ring around the rosey attacks), [/spoiler] but overall, the bosses fight fair and square. I also really like that some boss attacks can only be dodged by jumping, which adds a layer of fun to a fight. Couple that layer of fun with the number of weapons, ash of war, incantations, and spells that you can use, and you can see how much depth the combat mechanic of Elden Ring has.\n\nThe NPC quest this time around, though, has really improved in flexibility and quality. Unlike in previous Souls games, where you talk to some NPC and progress their questline to a certain extent, then forget about them for some time only to find them in a ditch somewhere because you didn't do a certain thing or progressed through the game too much, all of that is somewhat fixed. NPCs in Elden Ring stay still in the last spot you saw them unless you progress through the game, which causes some part of their questline to be skipped, or if you progress their questline by exhausting their dialogue or giving them a specific item. You can even do some quests after you've beaten the game, unless, of course, that specific NPC questline is tied to a boss or some other things that became inaccessible after some time. I really recommend a spoiler-free guide if you want to experience these questlines on your own.\n\nLet's now move on to the flaws that I have mentioned in the title. After a certain point in the game, you can feel that enemy variety and level design have been thrown out the window (if you played the game, then you would know the part I'm describing). Enemies that have no reason to be there are there, and the amount of damage they deal is on par with some of the early-game optional bosses. I didn't really mind the repetitive and reskin-optional bosses because, \"Eh, whatever that still makes sense,\" but if you start placing enemies at a location where it doesn't really make sense to be, then that's just lazy. This dip in quality is clearly noticeable, and I just slugged through that specific section as fast as I could, but I'm really glad that the quality picked up again right at the end of the game because that would have left a scar in an otherwise really great game.\n\nOverall, Elden Ring really exceeded my expectations of what an open-world game could be, and it really deserves the Game of the Year title it has. Let yourself be cast into an unknown world and explore it, finding every secret or taking your own pace. No matter what suits you, you will have a great time. You will experience Insomia for weeks, but in exchange, you will experience one of the best games of all time. I'm really excited to play the DLC once it comes out, and also, [b]where is the Bloodborne PC port [/b]?\n\u00a0", "timestamp_created": 1712210949, "timestamp_updated": 1712226277, "voted_up": true,

Spell spam (when a boss/enemy spams spells over and over instead of actually doing anything unique or fun), AoE spam (Same thing as spell spam but instead of spamming spells they're spamming attacks that deal damage in an Area of Effect), combo spam (Same thing as above but instead of whatever it's high damage fast attacking combos), or spamming roll catchers (moves that have delayed attacks designed to trick you into rolling early). Sometimes, you may even get a \"new\" thing where they combine the things I mentioned into one singular enemy!\r\nOh, there's also damage over difficulty (which imo is the worst offender here), which basically just when they decide to make something deal a ludicrous amount of damage instead of actually making it a difficult fight, which leads me into why I don't consider this game to be \"open-world\". The damage/health scaling for this game is... abysmal? Yeah, abysmal. Nearly every area you enter until over half way through the game you just feel so weak. Either because you don't have enough health to survive the attacks, or you don't have enough damage to not take an eternity just to kill the one enemy/boss so you CAN level up and try to get more HP/damage, leading to the game not really being \"open-world\" but a linear game with a strong suggestion on where to go. Like, I don't want to spend hours farming, I want to spend hours PLAYING. Farming runes is not playing, it's just mindlessly repeating the same exact movements over and over and over and over and over and over again just so that you CAN actually play the game! IT'S NOT FUN!\r\n\r\nTruly and honestly, I think this game has some of the best features of all the soulsborne games, but the combat is just so horrible to me that I grit my teeth and wonder \"why am I even playing this?\" every single time I launch it, because it's just amplified every problem I had with the old soulsborne games in an attempt to make things more \"DiFfIcUlT\", leading to the game just feeling annoying to me rather than challenging. I sunk nearly a thousand hours into DS3 because whenever I died I felt like there was something to learn on my end to do better. Passed my first playthrough of this game, it's rarely ever felt like my fault for dying, it just feels like the game's trying to be as annoying as possible. From the combo spam, combo's which have roll catchers for every attack in the combo, the endless FP they gave NPC's because... well just because, the auto parry they gave some NPC's because... well because, to the endless stamina they gave NPC's, well... you get my point, making every fight with them a game of waiting for an opportunity to attack (which is also the problem with many of the bosses in this game as well, but I'll get onto that in a bit). I play games to have fun. Expecting me to be perfect isn't fun, it's exhausting and annoying.\r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with the bosses is that they just don't make sense. Why give a boss an extremely high damage combo that homes onto you? Because it's \"DiFfIcUlT\". Why let a boss like the big red fox just keep jumping every half second while spamming spells non stop that home onto you? \"DiFfIcUlTy\". Why make a boss fight like Maliketh who just jumps away from you, spams combos that drain HP on hit as well as limit HP on hit (You know, that system of limiting HP like they did in DS2? That thing everyone loved :| )? \"DiFfIcUlTy\". Why throw the same bosses in stupid places over and over and over and over again? \"DiFfIcUlTy\". Like, the dual godskin duo bossfight is literally just the same \"bosses\" (let's be real with ourselves, these aren't bosses when you fight them as much as this, they're just large enemies, like the dogs in Caelid), except here's the kicker, THERE'S MORE HP THAN THE TWO OF THEM COMBINED! Meaning you have to kill them, have them respawn, so you cna kill them AGAIN! SO MUCH FUCKING FUN! HAHAHAHA! Piss off.\r\n\r\nBy pushing themselves to the point they have, they have begun to show the cracks in the armor of Soulsborne, showing us the problems they've had from the start, the only difference is that they're in full view now.

thing, this is not  a fun game, is a very FRUSTRATING game, even more if it is your first souls like game, which in my occasion it was, I believe that are many other games out there that mimic elden ring but are not frustrating as elden ring, so if  you wanna have fun and not be frustrated most of the time dont play this game and play another, but putting aside all that, this game was phenomenal, the desing, music, map, bosses, weapons, armors and lore and much more it was all amazing, and overcoming each frustration I had with this game was amazing and it taught me many things, I recommend

The open world is better than that of any other game I've played. It doesn't rely on meaningless checkbox-based exploration. The bosses, although not perfect, are, as a whole, quite fun to fight, especially [spoiler]Morgott, Radagon, and Godfrey[/spoiler]. The legacy dungeons are amazing.

is a great game, nothing can really come close to it in terms of open world design and exploration (mostly, the only thing that does a better job in the exploration department would be Metro Exodus) and the gameplay (enemy design, character move-sets, etc. etc.) is incredible fun. \nNow I don't have much to say about the good things, this is Dark Souls 4, if that sounds good, have fun.\nnow the bad. \nI'm gonna sound like i'm going hard on it here but you criticise what you love the most.\n\nWhat I have a problem with and this harms the gameplay too, is the sheer amount of repetition, The enemies and bosses you fight at the beginning of the game are unironically the same bosses you'll be fighting at the end. there are only 8~ish truly unique, un-repeated bosses in the game and it being an around 50+ hour experience means you'll spend a lot of time before encountering new enemies.\n\nNow I'm not saying that the bosses that are copy pasted all over the place aren't good, it's just that it makes any subsequent encounters with them completely boring. By complete chance I ended up encountering almost every single boss in the game through their 'duplicate' versions first, so whenever I found the originals any sense of tension or challenge eats dirt.\n\nAlso another big problem I have with the game is the completely schizophrenic progression, If you listen to the game and 'follow the grace' without going full Skyrim and exploring then by the time you get around to what the game doesn't tell you is the first area everything will die incredibly quickly. Not to mention that the directly intended route will be several magnitudes more difficult until your level catches up.\n\nThere are also some problems with enemies occasionally having attacks that feel straight out of Sekiro but that's a whole other topic I don't want to get into here, this isn't the first time I've just said 'go watch this review' in a steam review but go watch Joseph Anderson's review of Elden Ring, It'll cover everything.", "timestamp_created": 1712100232, "timestamp_updated": 1712101888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162070602": {"recommendationid": "162070602", "author": {"steamid": "76561199107041961", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 11193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 9158, "last_played": 1714011332}, "language": "english", "review": "easy it not just in danile", "timestamp_created": 1712099793, "timestamp_updated": 1712099793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162070450": {"recommendationid": "162070450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986499892", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 13396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 463, "playtime_at_review": 12507, "last_played": 1714297182}, "language": "english", "review": "Miyazaki is my dad", "timestamp_created": 1712099639, "timestamp_updated": 1712099639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162070447": {"recommendationid": "162070447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088089329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4018, "last_played": 1676009575}, "language": "english", "review": "Girl talk to me :)", "timestamp_created": 1712099635, "timestamp_updated": 1712099635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162070303": {"recommendationid": "162070303", "author": {"steamid": "76561199653251258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1713232445}, "language": "english", "review": "GOATED", "timestamp_created": 1712099484, "timestamp_updated": 1712099484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "162070082": {"recommendationid": "162070082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346362994", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 799, "last_played": 1702511846}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of my top 10 games this decade for sure!

weapon list with some pretty good ashes of wars to put on weapons.\n- very enjoyable as a first play-through to explore the map and find new things.\n- pretty good questlines.\n- beautiful game depending on graphics settings or mods.\n- enjoyable mods, seemless coop, convergeance, things like that.\n- main bosses have pretty fun movesets if you're patient enough to learn.\n- spirit ashes r helpful for ppl who want to play it more casually ( although controversial )\n- amazing world building, most places when u enter u can see the end of the area to or where u end up going.\n- cool enemy/boss/character design\n- very good boss ost's ( not as good as bloodborne though zzz )\n- interesting enough characters and lore in the world, although not clear enough, ( seek youtube )\n- try fingers, but hole.\n\nCons. \n- Replaying the game and going through the map can be boring depending on yourself. for me knowing the game inside out and the locations of stuff makes it difficult to play again since i know to look for, first playthrough was a go explore now its a go from A to B to get this then kill boss and repeat. \n- good luck without fextra life interactive map in some situations. \n- not enough in the open world to keep you interested in replaying, the only good places r the main areas.\n- the bosses aside from main ones are pretty poor considering there is 165 and most of them arent single unique ones. im not mad was just a bit disappointing considering there are stuff like 2 astels?\n- no 40 vigor no fun\n- endgame scaling goes crazy considering morgott can be really easy with scaling and then all of a sudden it feels double the difficulty when going to fire giant.\n- summons can ruin the game on a first playthrough and sour the game for you.\n\n\nStill though, i love the game. just have some issues with it.\nDLC will be goated though.", "timestamp_created": 1712090735, "timestamp_updated": 1712090758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

expression \"Elden Ring isn't Dark Souls 4, its 4, 5 and 6 in one\" and I'm tempted to say that might even be a bit of an understatement. I'm not massive on open worlds and even for this one there was a good 10 or 20 hours in the middle that I was bored to tears tempted to just look up where to head next, I believe the main thing to consider if you have prior experience with especially the metroidvania esque souls games, you have to abandon some of the mindset with those games in regards to exploration and combat, this game is a masterclass of an open world games but it still comes with many of the fallings of the genre - hard to balance areas with some being far to easy or far to difficult depending on when you choose to tackle them, a lot of liminal moments (joke intended) between that you may find boring with an open world by design never ever being able to be as dense as a more linear game etc. If you look past your own biases however, you will most likely find Elden Ring an incredibly fulfilling experience, nigh on the best combat present in an open world game, an incredible story and lore even for the very very high bar other from games set, and goes without saying but drop down gorgeous, not only from a graphical point of view(beware there are some performance issues due to this) but from an awe inspiring art direction.

You're supposed to do Calid before Altus and Leyndell, yet the enemies there are a LOT stronger than the ones in Altus\n- build options are hidden throughout the game and thus make respec-ing into another more favorable built of yours a necessity, which is not a good design with limited respecs\n- the Arenas are genuinely the worst ones in any Fromsoft game like genuinely\n- movement feels clunky due to target locking, making the rather weird option of free camming the better feel, but also significantly more harder for the average player who doesnt play claw\n-  player level scaling is not intuitive. \"What level am I supposed to be?\" in areas with Vigor checks and also high density of enemies happenes countless times throughout the gameplay and the fact that you HAVE to be at a point in Vig. where 2 Flasks dont even full heal you... lets just say that doesnt help the feeling a player has\n- broken weapons and limited uses till Farum Azula due to limited (somber) smith stones => cant pivot to other weapons for a LONG time \n- parrys feel awful on some enemies, especially Malenia. I genuinely enjoy parrys in general, but when the timing for parrys isnt the same across the board, why am I even supposed to play with shields in this game and not just go a dex/strength build or mega prepare a Intellligence built, it just doesnt make any sense to have a skill expression like that in the game when it isnt across the board and you need to literally relearn it for a majority of enemies\n- a lot of repetitiveness in Bosses, Catacombs/graves, normal enemies, heck even weapons and spells\n- unnecessary pacouring with the worst movement controls of any game I have played\n\n\nIn short: I am not a fan of how this game feels to play, how it makes the play have to REALLY think on what build to go, how to prepare (if at all) for bigger Bosses and what to expect from enemies around the boss. Very unfun and useless parts keep appearing in this game as is and give the player a miniscule reward in most cases and at best 15min of wandering in an area trying to figure out a \"puzzle\" (hint: its a dark tunnel or an invisible wall).\n\nLove everything else about the game BESIDES the gameplay and thats why I cannot recommend this game for majority of players who want a good time, want to enjoy a chill game where they have a challenge but get rewarded. This game is none of these and is just a pure headache for anyone not taking it seriously.\nNo clue how this won GOTY honestly, I do have high hopes for the DLC though in terms of fixing problems.",

That is nearly inevitable in an open-world game.\nBut you cannot ignore the fact that you are not free to explore the world without risking of soft-locking most of the sub-quests (which the game gives no indication whatsoever) or without risking of overleveling.\nBut the worst offender in this game are the boss fights: really bad designed. They are hard but not challenging; it does not matter how good you are, if your character is not one of the meta builds you cannot defeat most of the main bosses. And no, being forced to follow a meta is not good game design (yes, even Let Me Solo Her is a meta build). Another very big problem with boss (and mid boss) fights is the spectacularization over gameplay. Most of the time you are forced to watch the boss doing all its acrobatics maneuvers while rolling away (yeah, shields don't really matters anymore), waiting, waiting and waiting for a split second window of opportunity to strike back, all while fighting against a camera view not intended for such choreography.\nWe are far away from the tactical and metodical fighting mechanic of Dark Souls.

\"Soulsborne\" as a whole, particularly improving on Dark Souls 3. \nIt's easily the most accessible souls game thus far, with it being open world, and having a \"play it at your own pace\" attitude, as well providing tons of get out of jail free cards for newbies; from spirit ash summons to weapons that are broken OP in PvE, such as the \"Rivers of Blood\" Katana or the \"Blasphemous Blade\" greatsword, or even assistance in the form of online co-op with a buddy. As such, ER can simultaneously be the most difficult souls game ever, OR the easiest souls game ever, depending on how much you want to take advantage of these tools. At the very least, I'm proud of myself for managing to beat the main story as a STR build without using any spirit ashes as per me being a souls veteran, but again, it was purely my choice; mimic tear and Banished Knight Oleg can bail you out if it's too hard for ya. I'm still feeling torn in some aspects about the game though; no dragon in the game can match Midir from DS3 and I still think that balancing the game around spirit ashes make it preposterously difficult times, particularly against the likes of the infamous Malenia; but I guess there's already plenty of youtubers and and \"letmesoloher\" that have beaten her without any cheap tricks as well. All in all, a fantastic game, and well worth the money at $40-60.

Elden Ring is basically a culmination of all the things the fans of the souls franchise love, but with so much more.

"language": "english", "review": "Obviously still very early impressions for how long of a game this is meant to be. I have explored a decent chunk of the starting area and have faced quite a few dungeon bosses now.\r\n\r\nI have become a from software fan in the past couple of years, Having played first bloodborne and then sekiro - and now understand the joy that these games bring to many, including myself. I think Sekiro is one of the few 10/10 games I have ever played, and I could see myself potentially enjoying Elden Ring to that same level.\r\n\r\nThe worlds that from software are able to create never cease to amaze me. The atmosphere in this game immediately makes itself known with the big glowing tree you can see in the horizon pretty much all the time. The lore begs for you to learn more, and piece together the bits of information available. As for gameplay, fighting tree sentinel at level 1 was fun. Struck memories of gyobu in Sekiro. I can see why so many were upset at launch now, which makes it even funnier knowing I had to actively seek out his attention so he would start fighting me. The core of these games are all the same, Fight big bad over and over, learning everything about him until you know what he is going to do before even he knows. And using that information to punish them. Spirit ashes are a great optional addition to the game that are there for most optional bosses I've come across, although some boss are restricted in their use. These give you summons to help if you are new. This makes the game pretty newbie friendly, even if the boss move sets are sometimes annoying to deal with. Would recommend to anyone like me as a relatively new fan of these types of games that is still considering whether or not to buy, and would cautiously recommend to anyone looking to get into the franchise. I still think bloodborne is the easier game, but I can see the larger mass appeal in Elden Ring.\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1711935303, "timestamp_updated": 1711935303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161922657": {"recommendationid": "161922657", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085888920", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9378, "last_played": 1712023520}, "language": "english", "review": "Greatest game of all time", "timestamp_created": 1711934801, "timestamp_updated": 1711934801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161922516": {"recommendationid": "161922516", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066080281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1712016587}, "language": "english", "review": "bad", "timestamp_created": 1711934641, "timestamp_updated": 1711934641, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412951648235321045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161922269": {"recommendationid": "161922269", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467810208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 593, "playtime_at_review": 1045, "last_played": 1714009506}, "language": "english", "review": "wow", "timestamp_created": 1711934351, "timestamp_updated": 1711934351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161921281": {"recommendationid": "161921281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070900069", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "playtime_at_review": 5856, "last_played": 1714244155}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Hard but rewarding\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1711933017, "timestamp_updated": 1711933017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161921257": {"recommendationid": "161921257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164195320", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 29256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 601, "playtime_at_review": 26172, "last_played": 1714096537}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1711932977, "timestamp_updated": 1711932977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161920812": {"recommendationid": "161920812", "author": {"steamid": "76561199261823648", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "playtime_at_review": 9158, "last_played": 1714181726}, "language": "english", "review": "Pain", "timestamp_created": 1711932437, "timestamp_updated": 1711932437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "161920657": {"recommendationid": "161920657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038091715", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 3780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1712795983}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you played souls game before? then you have played this.

And there's plenty more that I can't think of right now, and probably much more that need to be added. \n\nThe game definitely doesn't need a traditional \"difficulty slider\" as the game mechanics can influence how hard or easy the game can be. Have a tough time with a boss or an area? Go somewhere else and level up a bit on easier enemies. Need just a bit more damage or something that can take aggro or tank? Summon spirit ashes. There's plenty of mechanics like this that you can opt in or out of in order to modify your experience to your liking.\n\nExcellent bosses, impeccable lore and storytelling, various weaponry and armor
