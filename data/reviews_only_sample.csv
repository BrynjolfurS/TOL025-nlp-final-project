review
"Great. Hard to master, but once you learn the mechanics and get used to gameplay is really satisfying. Easily in my top 3 From Software games and GOTY 2019.
"
"The best Souls game in my opinion. Smooth combat, great graphics, awesome and fun bosses, references to the previous instalments throughout - a great end to the Souls games"
"This game is the ultimate test in patience. Eventually, the wall will break so long as you keep hitting your head against it."
"I cummed, shidded and farded. 11/10"
Cant change key bindings. 11/10
"Great game, little dated obviously but great none the less. Not sure why everyone made it out to be so hard, you will die a fair amount at the start but once you get rolling it is no big deal. Was able to 1 shot almost every boss with ease. Great exploration if you are in to that kind of stuff. Off to the next one!"
"If you want the most in depth review of your life, just message me. I'll tell ya all about it. This game is amazing. Amazing. Do not assume my steam time played is anywhere near representative of the time I've spent in this game. Buy it."
nice game for who want destroy his pc :D
"Praise the sun 

10 outta 10 would die again"
"Don't buy Escape from Tarkov. Buy this game instead. They aren't similar at all, in fact they're very different. This game is good and enjoyable, with a challenge. Tarkov is bad and not enjoyable, with suffering."
"Wish this was what was shown to us before launch, but still good imo."
"Sword Saint Isshin Ashina took my sanity, good game tho"
Such a nice game if you  know how to fight. I don't
Boobs are cool and so is Dark Souls 3
The Soulsborne series are some of the games ever made.
"Almost overwhelmed on the first game opening. Unlike Dark Souls 1, which is known for the harness of sound simplicity as one stares at despair in the face when he might only hear the sound of silence along with his own footsteps, the use of music in this third part of the trilogy is absolutely a refreshing experience. Athough the atmosphere is somehow less dark-soulish like its 2 predecessors, I sincerely believe that the journey to come will worth my while."
"I like this game. A lot of people judge it without playing it. It's very fun! The game gives you plenty of upgrade materials and items to respec your character. It encourages a lot of experimentation, which is good. If you are on the fence about this game, try it out before you listen to all those souls youtubers. Very good game, a solid 8.9/10"
I would for sure recommend this game to anyone who may be vulnerable to Stockholm Syndrome
I have a supped 2000£ comp. Tries to play dark souls.. Won't load.. white screen upon loading.. Feelsbadman.. Even getting into the game is diffucult..
"If you like From Software's other games then you will be pleased with the best game they have ever made. You will get dumptered and cumstered but once you learn the real mechanics you will see its amazing. Realize that the three perilous attacks are not just cheese and that there are counters to all three. Most boss fights that seem impossible can be countered with items  or unique abilities. This game is not for the ADHD kids. YOU WILL GET SHIT STOMPED, even if you are a god at BB/DS/Nioh this will be a challenge."
"Really good dark souls series game, I have had no problems with it and haven't crashed, but it appears others have this problem, dont know why, I get perfect frames with max settings."
"I want to like this game, but I can't. It takes away too much that the Souls games have built up, and offers too little in return. With that said I have now beaten the game, and my opinion hasn't changed. In fact I would say I like it even less. Where the souls series offered a fair challenge that players could overcome with skill, Sekiro requires repetition and move memorization to beat almost all the bosses in the game. This means you wont beat 95% of the bosses on skill alone. You will beat them because you put in the time( sometimes hours) to learn their moves and practice fighting them. This leads to tedium and a shallow sense of accomplishment in what should be a fast paced rewarding experience.  6/10"
"That great epic feeling that you had in Dark Souls is back. Keyboard mapping is greatly improved, except for the button delay, which is annoying and makes certain actions very difficult to pull off. The mapping options are limited as well. The game this time around looks absoulutely gorgeous! A must have game!"
"Before I begin, there are so many amazing things about this game that make it shine in so many ways. The world created in Dark Souls 1 that was expanded in the following installments is just so awesome. From a story standpoint, and from an overall visual standpoint, Dark Souls 1 is so fun to explore.

However, from a level design standpoint, I was absolutely pushed over the edge by how unfinished and lousy some of the zones in this game were, that I have to leave a negative review. Sure, the absurdity and difficulty of Blighttown, for example, is one of the defining feature of Dark Souls, and so is the box of death that is Sen's Fortress. But with the narrow, frustrating path to Capra Demon, the lazy placement of enemies in Demon Ruins, the lack of enemy diversity in Oolacile, and the Silver Knight archers of Anor Londo, it gets to be a bit much. At what point do these level features actually exist for the player as anything but a frustrating obstacle or even just a disappointment. I especially remember walking into Demon Ruins and seeing a huge group of Taurus Demons just situated in one spot, all facing the same direction, standing still, seemingly guarding nothing. It just didn't make sense.

A lot of people have problems with the clunky rolls, hitboxes, easy bosses, and the like. But honestly I can look past that because this was one of the first games of its kind, and the software used back then was a lot different. The level design, though, is was frustrated me the most. And it frustrates me still because this game had such amazing areas like Anor Londo, Darkroot Garden, and Ash Lake, but other areas are so unbearable and unpolished that it ruins the overall experience.

Anyway, don't let this review take away from the fact that the music, visuals, and story of this game are phenomenal. I personally just didn't like playing the game all the way through. I personally would not recommend playing this game. Rather, watch a playthrough and laugh at the struggles of the streamer, read up on the games lore, and give the soundtrack a listen."
"Second best game ever (Dark Souls 1 is my all time favorite). This game is in a league of it's own when to comes to action RPG's). I really hope this is not the Last Game in this series. Some people say the game is too hard, I think it's challenging and makes you think and use techniques and strategies to over come some sections and bosses."
"trying beat nameless king, and i died 40 times"
"Set White Soapstone down.
Get summoned to another world.
Host summons another Phantom for a total of 3.
Host gets invaded by Dark Spirit.
Dark Spirit baiting us into a narrow path full of mobs.
Point at host to go up stairs which [spoiler]spawns a Dragon.[/spoiler]
Push the invader back into a narrow path where the mobs are.
Sit and enjoys the show, [spoiler]Dragon[/spoiler] wipes the tunnel clear of all mobs.
10/10 would bait again."
"New favorite ""Souls"" game. Combat is great and the difficulty is difficulty done right. No damage sponge enemies. All about understanding your enemies."
"Give me warm, give me soft"
Best racing game of 2016 no doubt about it big car big speed yes
Absolutely dialed in. More similar to the first game than the second.
"There will be a very fat guy and his little friend protecting a [b]very massive[/b] and [b]amazing[/b] chest inside the city somewhere. You cant miss it!

10/10"
"i love the game, how it looks, bosses, everything!"
"One of my favourite games yet, great visuals and storytelling. If you treat this game like a rythm game you will have a great time with it. Its fast paced and i havent had much trouble with bosses if you get their rythm down.

One of my favourite fromsoftware games to date.

"
"Game has anti cheat so harsh that so much as suggesting a visual mod to a friend could get them banned, yet despite having a clean record every 3rd person I invade to steal their embers is a script kiddy with stagger immunity and infinite health. The good thing though is there is no safety from the kill boxes off cliffs, 10/10 would knock hackers off ledges again."
"pro
- Big world and much to explore 
- much weapons and spells. same as in DS1 but more. 
- Many optional areas which you can discover how- and whenever you like
- much bosses 
- still has a large playerbase 

Cons:
- the expantions feels rushed and not so polished as the game itself. 
- feels abit easy some bosses is really easy. makes the game not feels ""souls"" at all. 
- sometimes questionable leveldesign and enemy placement enemys don't rush they sometimes just stand and look at a wall or something. 
"
"A lot of people say this game is really hard; and it is at first, but after like 20 minutes it becomes easy"
"DS1 First half > DS2
DS1 Second half < DS2

This game does not favour players running through areas, but drawing enemies out slowly I never found ganking too much of an issue. Adaptability is a must for a pleasant time though. Overall had a good time with the game, dont be put off by bad reviews"
"There are some things that only videogames can do. For me, Dark Souls' predecessor Demon's Souls was emblematic of all of them. Where most games do their best to be something else – to tell a story like a novel, to impress with cinematic techniques like a film – Demon's Souls is pure game, a complete and darkly fascinating vision that makes no concessions to the modern conception of how games should be. Instead, it was an exploration of how games could be; how bleak, how twisted, how focused and – most famously – how challenging. Most developers take pains to protect you from failure. FROM Software turns it into an artform.
Dark Souls is the next step along that path. Like Demon's Souls, it is a brutal and demanding third-person action-RPG set in a world full of monstrous, disturbing things that are trying their hardest to end your life as quickly as possible. Using whatever weapons and armor you can scavenge, buy or forge, the challenge is to inch your way through this damned and deadly place, now and then coming across gigantic bosses that take especial valor and tenacity to kill. The eventual aim is to make it out alive, but there are about 50-60 hours of creative cruelty between you and that goal.

You will die, a lot. You will die on the end of a sword, on the edge of an axe, crushed by a boulder, impaled on fangs; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Dark Souls. It's education, it's progress, it's the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in gaming – it can take over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Exactly because your chances of success are so slim, each victory feels monumental. The open-world structure is the biggest change since Demon's Souls. Beginning in a rotting asylum for the undead, you move through a vast, connected world comprised of fetid swamps, grandly dilapidated towns and castles, magma-carved caves and tunnels deep within the earth, trap-filled dungeons and much else. Some are reminiscent of Demon's Souls' environments, like the rickety, swampy, disease-ridden Blighttown, whilst others are entirely new; austere marble palaces, murky forests, ashen lakes.

The further you get in Demon's Souls, the more hideous and creative the monsters and environments become. Thirty hours in, stuck in an underground poisonous swamp, you'll feel like you'd give anything to see the sun again. Dark Souls' design is so consistently twisted that it actually starts to encroach on your mental well-being after extended play – it never wavers for a second from its singular stylistic vision.

There's no central hub, no safe haven for you to run back to and recuperate. Instead, there are bonfires strategically placed around the world. Bonfires are your checkpoints, the place where you can hunker down to replenish your health flasks, spend the souls of vanquished enemies on leveling up, repair your equipment, and meditate on your doomed existence. Resting at a bonfire ensures that you'll spawn there the next time you're dispatched, but resting also resp
"
"We're the fan of Dark Soul, we play it without any reason."
"This game made me reach a state of depression. 

If you've played and enjoyed DS3, DS2 is a game you should not even bother playing. The game's design is horrible compared to the latter of the series and you are going to miss a ton of things that are obscured by a dumb ""game mechanic"" that requires consumables to progress on that aspect.

The boss weapons vendor is hidden behind a consumable item. You cannot sell items except by finding one specific NPC. This game has no Embers, but it works the exact opposite way, it has Effigies that max out your HP, as each time you die, you lose temporary max HP.

I've beaten more than half the game to reach a boss fight that can oneshot me because I have no access to Effigies, as my HP is stuck at 50%, and I cannot even upgrade boss weapons because in this game boss weapon upgrading and farming is VERY late game.

I am level 110 and I am dying to dumb ambushes in random locations that are for level 40s solely because of the fact that you can have less HP than a level 40 at max HP has.

This game feels like it is developed by a group of monkeys with typewriters, but instead of typewriters, they have computers and nobody to tell them what to do."
"Dark Souls, the original and instigator of a benchmark in 3rd person, stamina-based melee combat that is adopted widely today, much like how Batman's combat greatly influinced future free-form brawlers.

It's as grand as it's archaic, 4-direction rolls, inventory management is done in linear vertical menus and one of the awkward jumping that is more fiddle-some then Tomb Raider 1.

Bottom-line: It's a great game that it's gameplay had captured the imaginations of both gamer and developer alike."
game is easier than you think
"40$ remastered i will say ok 
but same glitches and props?
really?
"
"A worthy successor to DS1.  Long game, a lot more bosses than the first.  Some interesting mechanics, boss and area designs. Overall I like the changes from DS1 to DS2 (minus soul memory...).  Agility is the new poise. ;)"
As much as i love this game it sure does make me wanna kms every time I play. <3
It's a Souls game. It's not Dark Souls 2. What more can I say?
I got vored by a fucking chest
"i dont know why i keep dragging myself to play this everyday, but there must be a good reason."
Give me already Dark Souls 4. Or Demon Souls 2. Or Bloodborne 2. JUST GIVE ME SOMETHING!
if u up for a challenge this game is for u
the FOUR KINGS IS SOOOOO MUCH FUN I LOVE FIGHTING A BOSS THAT I CANT HIT
"Well this is my thoughts with many many hours of play into this game.

Pros: PVE. PVE is rewarding and fun with an extensive loar around items and good storys to piece together,

Cons: End game is PVP. That would be a good thing except their pvp in this game is a joke and who ever did their Networking plans/support for the pvp should be fired. Expect phantom hits, back stabs, and enough bs to ruin this game for u.

I loved DS1 and DS2 is fun as well but if you plan to play this game online for any sort of rewarding pvp experiance you will be very disappointed."
"Definitely my GOTY for 2016 hands down. It brings back what I loved about 1 with some touches of bloodbourne. There's a ton of variety in weapons and enemies, allowing for huge replayability.

On a critical note, covenants and magic need work, mostly in adding new spells, or improving covenant mechanics.

There is still a DLC coming out, so that's nice.

Hypu for Bloodbourne 2 non-exclusive?"
"If Dark Souls 3 was played at 3x speed, it would literally just be a Sonic the Hedgehog game"
"its good, i mean the hours played should say enough, its hard in the beginning but it gets easier with time(like 90% of all games) i can beat inner isshin without kuro's charm with demon bell with ease on my #4th playthrough (it gets progressively harder with every playthrough in a single save, so just be patient and enjoy this masterpiece :)"
too hard for my wittle brain !! :3
Fun game. I don't like when they kill me but it's okay because I understand and I respect them.
"While the game itself didn't take long to beat by my standards (Keep in mind I am a Souls veteran) my first playthrough did not disappoint, with plenty of secrets to find. And as with all previous Souls games, the singleplayer is only half the experience. The community is vibrant and lively, and whenever I want to PvP or Co-op it takes mere seconds to find a matchup. The new covenant system is great."
great difficulty. though it is due to a lack of health.
"It has some fun mechanics, and the story's not so bad. Good game to invest some time and kill samurais and shit.

I very much still prefer Dark Souls, though."
"I'm really not sure. I think I like this, I think I like the torture, I think..."
"This has been one of the best games I've played, and it ends the series off on such a nice note. I hope that there will still be souls like games in the future, because this game and it's franchise have created almost a genre of challenging and engaging sword fighting  games."
"Did not enjoy this game at all.

The game forces you to use a parrying system to do the lions share of damage. 
Blocking makes you vulnerable and this is the primary way you dispatch enemies, you either parry them or break their block,It's just not for me
A very different game to dark souls, you have many tools at your disposal, the levels are well crafted.

However i find the game too difficult for me and i have completed and 100% achievements on every dark souls game.
The boss battles to me were far too difficult which is a shame because the story was interesting, but ill never find out how it transpires because its beyond my skill level.

"
"Having put myself through DS1, I was expecting DS2 to be a complete pushover. I was wrong. Very wrong in fact, as I learned within the first ~10 hours of playing. Your character seems much more vulnerable and enemies far more aggressive, which actually makes the experience more enjoyable, once you get used to it...
The premise of the game is not dissimilar to DS1, or indeed any ""Souls"" game; free exploration of the game world with little initial explanation of the plot, and arguably the most flexible class/level-up system in all of gaming to allow the player to (attempt to) survive said world as they see fit. This game isn't really about its plot however, more about the challenge of surviving and exploring the game world; if plot is what you're after, play Witcher!
Some minor changes to gameplay have been made, but nothing too special or that hasn't been seen before from its predecessors (DeS, DS1).

+ Expansive game world with more aggressive AI than DS1; makes surviving areas/exploring/getting to places much more satisfying, world is more realised than DS1, more varied (particularly with DLC).
+ Character is more realistically vulnerable in this game.
+ Good level design linking areas together in unexpected ways, but sadly negated by ""warp"" system at bonfires.
+ Free choice of skillsets/weapons means great flexibility in how encounters can be tackled. No ""right"" way to play the game.
+ Some minor puzzle elements (particularly DLC), which were not expanded greatly upon.

- Game is not that different from predecessors; not particularly original plot, borrows heavily from other games in series (enemies and their animations, some bosses).
- Gameplay becomes predictable (yes, there is an enemy waiting around this corner too!); insults player's intelligence by overusing the same kind of tricks repeatedly.
- There are some elements of gameplay which are intended to be ""innovative"" but are actually just plain cheap (e.g. invisible enemies in a particular section).
- Bosses are much easier in this game compared to DS1, and as such do not really feel like ""bosses"" in the same sense; not memorable as in DS1 (for instance who could forget O&S?!). Indeed, some of the DS2 bosses are either direct copies or rip-offs. Additionally, more varied bosses would have been welcome, rather than mostly giant ""blokes with swords"".

If you own Demon Souls, or Dark Souls 1, there is no need to play this game really, with DeS being the best of the series. There is nothing truly new or original here in comparison; it is really just more of the same."
"awesome game, don't give up skeleton!"
Everything is great. I only dislike the fact that you cant personalize your character
"The real joy in this game is being able to play with friends, and then clipping all their deaths whilst laughing maniacally (especially when one specific friend can't get passed Gael, or the Nameless King turning that friend into the sun multiple times).

Once you have enough clips, upload said montage on YouTube and immortalise your friends losing their thumbs being trash at Soulsborne.

10/10"
"A fun and enjoyable dark fantasy game, and a satisfying conclusion to the Dark Souls series. The aspect I've had the most fun with is the PVP, invading, being invaded, and Arena. there's issue with it, sure, but I've had a good time with it, and would invite anyone to pick it up."
"Arguable worth buying at $40. Definitely worth buying at $20.

It's not easy to get into, but it is definitely a lot of fun if you invest the time."
based but rx 570 gamers are the most oppressed minority in the world
"I played this back in the summer 2016, and it's yet the game I've so far put most hours into on Steam.
It was really great and I was able to play on my laptop I had back then.
Had prior to that played through Dark Souls on xbox a few times, 
and it was a big difference to play on pc with Dark Souls 2. I liked that I could get more accuracy.
I really liked the gameplay, I played through NG+ perhaps more, I don't remember.
I can still hear Majula's theme song, so peaceful."
"Easily the best way to play dark souls, it improves on the base game in many ways. Especially if you use ultrawide monitors or want native 60fps support."
"Going into this game with a Dark Souls mentality will probable make you go hollow, as Sekiro is a different beast entirely. There are many differences between this and the souls games, but the one thing that never changes is the joy you get from slaying a hard Boss (and there are many.)

I would have highly recommended this game, that was until I reached the final boss... I'm not going to spoil this fight, but I'm safe in saying that it was ridiculously hard. Obviously the victory was so sweet, but the grind to get there is real. If you can stand to grind a boss for days... maybe weeks, then I would recommend. If not then I would steer clear."
i remember my tour in dranglake ...lost allot of good me's in that valley....10 outta 10 would have ptsd flashbacks again
"To whoever made Bed of Chaos,

I hope you step in a lego for the rest of eternity"
Crazy fun and challenging. Every boss you beat makes you feel more and more accomplished. Also the pvp is top notch
best game ive ever played and i play very good games
Very enjoyable game built on a system that allows you to approach most problems in a variety of ways and strongly rewards skillful play while punishing mashing.
"This, ladies and gentleman, is by far one of the most catching games i´ve ever played!

Totaly recommended!"
Doesn't work on LG C3 OLED at 12 bit color depth native res. Instantly out of signal when going full screen. No borderless windowed mode available without mods. That's a refund for me.
This is one of my favorite games of all time and I am glad to play it on PC too now! 11/10 I recommend playing with a controller though.
"It was hard, I have to admit. I will definitely play more soul games. The experience in this game is not the story or the adventure itself, but the fact that you have finished one of the hardest games in the world. Thank you DarkSouls"
One of the best games I've ever played and a worthy ending to the DS - saga.
PRuns at a crisp 4k/60fps on a 7700k & 1080 with what feels like better frame pacing than Prepare to Die with DSFix.
Played this with two other friends a couple of times before and after the release and recently finished it. Its a joy to play albeit with some balance issues i felt otherwise i highly recommend this little gem.
"It's Dark Souls 1 But BetterTM

not worth 50 bucks, but if you have PTDE and want better multiplayer, this one's for you"
"Stopped at the last boss couldnt handle anymore lmao

31.12.2019 I DID IT FUCKING FINALLY YUSSS"
Frustratingly brutal but insanely addictive. I love how robust the combat is. There's such a weight to your character that most games can't showcase. 10/10
To all those who put it down because of difficulty: maybe rethink that decision.
"The perfect combination of the face-paced nature of Bloodborne combat and the deliberate nature of the Souls games.
Awesome story,  great settings, excellent enemy variety and design. 
Incredible replay-ability"
"Dark Souls 3, the most enjoyable Dark Souls game to be made. I have put in nearly 190hrs into the game and have not had one issue... except those fuckers who are hacking.... ,,!,,
Anyways... amazing game wish there were more."
I broke my controller twice but it was worth it.
"After finishing this 1 time I'm still hype to do it again.
There are 4 different endings, a lot of different interactions between characters and an amazing combat experience.
I cannot recommend more this game."
The final boss is way too easy. Other than that this is a great game that I can't recommend enough.
"*fell down from cliff and died*

*repeat 10 times*

*rage quit*

10/10 highly recommended so you guys can suffer the same thing"
"Got it on PS4 too just to play with a friend.
Game so nice you buy it twice."
"Full SotFS 20€ (-50%), Upgrade 20€ (-20%)

Nuff said."
"This game is some pukka ass shit, I'm serious, don't be a little bussy and use summons your first play through, honestly, just savour the countless deaths until you're numb inside and and an absolute pro dodge roller. 
10/10 would bonk some plin plin plons"
"Very good, but here is a tip:

[Spoiler] Summon a high-level friend for the whole game to play on easy mode. [/Spoiler]

its good and IT MAKES ME CRY
"I actually have second thoughts. This is the greatest most peakest gaming experience ever. I love lifegems and soul memory! My balls are a jiggling.

Love,

"This game series is notorious for being difficult. However this is a slightly deceiving description. The game isn’t hard. It is very straight forward with a clear path at most points. The reason it is “hard” is because the game forces you to die all the time. Combat revolves around you blocking or dodging an opponent’s attacks. This simply is not possible (due to preparation time of blocking or dodging) unless you have seen the animation before. The only way to see the animation is to have fought and died to the mob before. This essentially means that unless you are incredibly lucky, you will die on every new mob in the game before you can figure out all of its animations, so you know when to block/dodge and attack. To top it off, you lose all of your money/experience every time you die in addition to permanently losing max health. Why this game punishes you for something that it makes you do is beyond me. My recommendation is to save your money and skip this game."
"""CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS OF OBLIVION!""
11/10 would join the Dark Brotherhood again."
"Let me start off by saying, this game is my favorite, but only because this is the first SoulsBourne game that I actually spent a lot of hours in.  Since it is in a different universe from the other games, you aren't missing out on much apart from a handful of references. It most definitely is one of the easier games, apart from a few boss fights (Looking at you Nameless King). All in all I extremely recommend this game, especially with some friends for that good ol' JOLLY COOPERATION!"
"slaps, play randomizer once ur bored"
I SLAMMED MY DESK MORE THAN TWICE!!!
This is the one with the reindeer
"Absolute waste of time. Spent nearly 40 hours playing, the whole time it felt like a slog, with bad mechanics, bad camera movement, bad controls (which I ended up remapping to make slightly more usable), an abstract and uninteresting story, irritating icon placements (often quite far from boss battles), and bosses who are absolute damage sponges while serving up one shot kills. A challenge can be fun if the experience of being challenged is fun. Nothing about this experience is fun. It's a tedious, counter intuitive and unrewarding grind."
"Great game, wish they would make a sequel."
"You either git gut, or you live long enough to see yourself become The Last Giant one day."
"The weakest link in the Souls series by a large margin, but still a great game in its own right. More or less the ""Fallout 4"" of the series.

If you enjoyed the subtle story telling, genius level design, and tight controls of the first game, you WON'T find that here. What you WILL find is a fun little RPG that has lots of build variety and solid PvP mechanics. Definitely worth it if you're a diehard souls fan. However, if you're just enjoying Souls casually then I suggest skipping to the third game, as you won't be missing much in the way of a story anyways."
"Fantastic game, as all the other games from the franchise.

I wont downvote because of the optimization, but its true that the previous Dark Souls 2 / Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin had a better performance, in DS 3 i get around 40FPS in ANY graphics settings but still playable (at least for me) and there are more pros than cons in this title.
But be advised, if your gear is something like the Minimum Reqs. you will probably run this game at 30 fps or so, otherwise you are good to go.

But about the game itself, it is just wonderful. The enviroment, the lore and bgm all fits to give the player one of the most epic experience one can have. I had a lot of mind blows with the lore/story of the game, in every single detail the game show you a lot of its content that makes you more and more in love with the series, as all the previous Dark Souls games did."
"Not only does this game kill you with its intense combat, it actually makes you want to kill yourself in real life.
9/10 not enough gravelords"
"git gud 
haven't seen a better game than this
10/10"
"NEVER have I both HATED AND LOVED anything in my life so much!! Dark souls will make you want to rip your hair out, smack your momma, and go for that boss all over again red faced and furious!!!"
Okay game.  Good for someone who likes s story that is linear I suppose.  I returned just because I don't want to invest the time.
"Great game, yes it's hard but it's supposed to be like that."
"I have just broken my controller because I lost my souls, again, and again, and again ... I understand now why Valve makes a 40 % reduction on its pad for Dark Souls III players. 

10/10"
"             I have 600 hours on this game and i have played it 6 times. Darksouls 3 will draw you in with its unique and challenging game play and it will keep going with this concept. I originally came to this game because of quarntine and im suprised i haven't played it before as it quickly became my favourite and most played game. 

              There is only a few things to critzise with such a great game, hitboxes and online mode. I say wonky and not negitive because its just something that needs a bit of tweaking. Online is bad but only occasionly. This all depends on where they are reletive to you. If they are in your country and both of you have decent internet(a majority of the time) you will be fine. However if these conditions arnt met you can have lag where it looks like they are teleporting and hits that will take more than 10 seconds to process. this happens to many times for me not to mention it.  This is alot more rare but because this game is online hacking can happen more than you would exspect. 

             Online is also amazing at the same time. There is so much respect within the online community. If you duel someone there is almost an unwritten rule to do the bow taunt before a match. Because this game is so small you will probably be seeing the same 20 to 30 people but this just makes it so much more fun. Being able to interact with other people in this kind of way is great. It almost feels like your getting better with them when u probably see them the next day in an arena. The best way to explain the ds3 community is an inside joke and only you and your small group would get. 


            Next problem is the missleading and awkard hit boxes in this game. This is really simple honestly, hitboxes are either way smaller compared to the weapon or so large compared to the weapon that you could be having a family vacation on mars and something could still hit you.  

            Overall i would highly reccomend this game. The 2 flaws i could point out are overwhelmy covered by a great community and a great game. Please give from software your money <3<3<3.

Just waiting for an MMO this good to come out.
"fashion souls returns

for one final cycle

are you prepared to be fabulous?"
"A very fun game, highly recommend."
"The title is misleading, Sekiro did not in FACT die twice... He died bajillion of times instead"
"Changing my review back due to the reversal of the library sharing ban. Still, a bit scummy, but the whole game is excellent and just the amount of hours I've put into the game show how much I have replayed this."
how good is this game? well I got all the achievements
"A linear game that puts hard bosses in between the path to make the game lengthier than it should be.
No sense of satisfaction after defeating the bosses, just felt like the crap is finally over.
Why punish yourself by playing this game."
"Eh, I played it a little.

I guess it's okay."
This game reminds me of Souls and Bloodbornes child with no i-frames. Focus is more on blocking rather then rolling and reading situations. Very solid 8.7/10
"2nd best Dark souls there is!
And still better then this strange ***** DARK SOULS™ II: Scholar of the First Sin"
AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE FROM START TO FINISH 10/10
"maybe the real treasure was the friends we made along the way (to gank invaders who invade in shit zones like catacombs of carthus, irythyll dungeon, kiln of the first flame [mega cringe])

:)"
Atrocious controls.The refund feature saved me :))
"Very good game, but foking Nameless king is pain for me but my friends are saying its ez. I rlly recommend this game for somebody who likes self-harm"
thing is addictive can't get enough of it
Die thousand time but still feel good !

KILLING FINAL BOSS DARK SOULS 3 WITH TEARS"
"I died within minutes of having control of my character. 
10/10"
"Great atmosphere, open world rpg, really unforgiving at the start but very rewarding once you learn the basics and get some good weapons"
"It's an easier Dark Souls apart from a few bosses. This game has the same great game play from the other dark souls game with more added on. I'm playing this after beating sekiro and eldin ring and it still shines even if it isn't as hard as sekiro, and isn't as adventurous and filled with content as eldin ring."
"waste of time, like most fromsoft trash"
"Spoilers Ahead.

Dark Souls 2, Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin

I have played this game twice. Once in 2016 in anticipation for Dark Souls 3. And again 5 years later and 100%'d it.

Had this been 2016 I'd say this a bad game and an utter disappointment to the Souls series with uninspired, lazy, and boring bosses. But it's not 2016.

Let's start off with the good.

Variety. The game has a ridiculous amount of armor sets, probably the most out of the series, the drip is nice, and if I'll miss anything, that Forlorn Set and the King's Set. Fashion Souls was strong with this game even if the game had a hard on for fur. The fact that almost if not every weapon in the game can be made viable is something that no other game in the series has been able to say and it's definitely one of the strongest parts about this game. It makes me sad that both Twinblades and Powerstacing weren't in 3, because they are some of the funnest parts of this game.

DRANGLEIC CASTLE IS SICK. And Majula has a beautiful ocean view.

DLC. All 3 are the pinnacle of what the game should have been and it is a travesty the rest of the game didn't have the quality of what these added expansions had. Whether you were [spoiler] making the trek on giant chains in a land of ash to face the coolest re-skin in DS2 in Blue Coolade, facing the hardest boss in the game in an arena of ash against Fume Knight himself and his big sword. Or finding the sad memory of the long gone friend of the Old Iron King. +Shiny floors. [/spoiler] Or solving a labyrinth [spoiler] in a land infested by poison to take take down the evil queen Elana and put down the saddest of slumbering dragons. [/spoiler] Or surviving a blizzard and [spoiler] facing the cuddliest of the kings pets and plunging into the remnants of old chaos to seal portals with your knights and face off against the arguable most bada.. boss in the series, Ivory King making a Sauron from LotR introduction but with a lightsaber. [/spoiler] I really wish the rest of the game was the quality of the DLC, because the DLC's stole the show.

The world is relatively interconnected, and the introduction of immediate warping was welcomed.

Now that I'm done giving the game its due...

The game drops the ball when it comes to bosses. 42 total bosses, 32 in just the base game. From those 32, 3/4 are straight dog. I'll be ripping all the bosses a new one now. [spoiler] I'll forgive Last Giant, he's a tutorial boss and as such isn't supposed to be hard. Pursuer is bootleg Mr. X from Resident Evil 2, he has a sick intro annnnnd that's about it, I don't need him 6 times throughout the game. Chariot is a cool niche boss. Skeleton Lords are big skeletons that spawn little skeletons, they aren't anything special. Flexile Sentry is a basic enemy later on. Lost Sinner has an interesting Torch mechanic but otherwise felt boring other than on NG+, then it felt like more of a hassle than anything. Belfry Gargoyles are a reskin of a reskin. Ruin Sentinels are tall knights that are boring and generally easy. Both Royal Rat bosses are dog. One is a gank and the search for mohawk and the other is kill 4 rats and then a big hyenna rat. Nejka is reskin Quelaag.[/spoiler] [spoiler] Freja has 2 heads and the fight is easier with a torch cuz FIRE BAD. Mytha is Medusa, burn windmill or headache. The Rotten is a joke, run away from the only attack that even can hurt you. Fake Ornstein. Jabba the Hut. Some people hate Smelter, to me, he's just kinda there. Old Iron King is the biggest disappointment of a bada.. looking boss. Guardian Dragon, reskin of red drake, reskin of other red drake. Demon of Songs reminds me of something I would like to not see, it's a bad boss with an easy as hell mechanic to punish. Velstadt is really cool, but his fight is generally boring because slow easily read-able attacks. Vendrick is optional and has an interesting mechanic with the giant souls but he's easy and not really a threat. Dragonrider and the subsequent Super Dragon Bros. are just a beefy mini-boss, and the 2nd time isn't better than the first, at least the first is funny because of the cheese. Magus and Congregation are a bigger joke than Pinwheel. Giant Lord is Last Giant... WITH A SWORD OH MY GOD. No. It's lazy, easy, and bad. The war aspect of the memories is cool though. Ancient Dragon is just, kinda there. Wack, run to tail if he goes in the air, otherwise keep wacking, it's a boring boss fight compared to the rest of the series. Nashandra is the worst final boss in the series. She has an interesting curse mechanic but what's it matter when she swings slow and you can just hug her side the whole fight. Aldia a fight of patience is mostly boring, meant to just be lore-master. Looking Glass Knight has a great arena, music, and is sick itself with an interesting summon mechanic. Darklurker is the best base game boss. Sucks he is locked behind a covenant and is tedious to get to but the fight is overall challenging, sick and he has good move pool and a challenging mechanic to keep the fight fresh. Throne Watcher & Defender to me are alright, good mechanic idea with the healing and they compliment each other alright [/spoiler] .

Healing is broken in this game. 30,000 souls and bam, you got 99 Lifegems. And not only are there Lifegems, there's better lifegems, and EVEN BETTER LIFEGEMS. And not just that, there's like 10 different consumables that heal you while giving you other bonuses, so hell, the fact they nerfed the Estus Flask by making you having a limited supply and decreasing the heal from the first game, it doesn't even matter because you just pop 3 lifegems and bam, the same or more healing as 1 +5 Estus Flask. It's like they wanted to make the game easier without outright doing so.

ADP is garbage, I'm just gonna say it going from .6 seconds of i-frames to .1 almost .2 seconds of i-frames at base ADP is horrible. When I first played the game in 2016 I didn't know anything about ADP and Agility, so I hated every moment of rolling and still taking damage despite feeling like I had rolled through the attack at the correct moment, and added with the fact this game has jank hitboxes already, yeah, no, bad time. So much so that I immediately rushed 25 ADP to get 100 Agility and have close to Dark Souls 1, and 3 rolling i-frames. I get it, DS1, had a bit too generous of roll i-frames but my god, adding a whole stat for how fast you heal, cast, and how much you bs an attack by rolling into it, this was an unwelcome change.

Farming souls is a joke, you get so many souls and levels you don't even know what to do with them, and the soft cap and hard caps of stats were lowered so hell you're going to need them anyways.

The music was alright, wasn't memorable at all other than the ending credits, that, that right there was good music, and it really encapsulated the end of a long journey.

Sadly the lore just kind of reinforces what we already knew, doesn't matter what you do, link the fire, or let it fade, because someone will eventually do the other choice. Other than addressing the giants and the curse more, the lore just... missed the mark honest. Vendrick and the Old Iron King have the strongest stories behind them at least when it comes to backstory.

The NPC's in this one, sadly weren't memorable to me.[Spoiler] Lucatiel and Benhart are the only real characters I can say I even cared about, [/spoiler] Other than those 2, honestly, none were as memorable as say [spoiler] Sun Bro, Onion Bro, or even Big Hat Bro. [/spoiler] I'll say this, despite having the Emerald Herald be important in the story, she felt like any other firekeeper, pushing us to light the flame and fulfill your destiny.

Overall I felt this game wanted to be different. It had an identity problem. Tried to borrow the healing from Demon's Souls, tried to be ""Dark Souls 2"", and tried to out do Dark Souls 1.

4/10 It's an okay game. But it's a bad 'Dark Souls' game. I don't recommend it."
OMG SO HARD PLEASE ADD EASY MODE :((((((
I'm bad at this game but it's good
"Got Waifu.

Waifu then committed not alive after my victorious battle against the King.

Nicens't."
"100+ days without multiplayer.
They, also, removed the multiplayer tag of the steam page.
This behave says that they will not fix it, just like elden ring stuttering.
!!!! Ps: They fixed it, I can't believe it !!!!"
good when you're not dying
George RR Martin was not involved in the making of this game.
"Haven't played Dark Souls, this game was hard. But after a little bit of playing it sorta just ""clicks"" and you start doing better and better until it becomes almost poetic when you fight a new enemy/mini-boss/boss because the combat is so good."
Sekiro has no multiplayer and lacks the build diversity of other From games. The tradeoff is some of the most balanced and exciting combat in the series. Sekiro's introduction of multiple responses to attacks forces the player to pay close attention rather than just roll spam. The addition of the posture system encourages players to be aggressive rather than just chip health down slowly. Together these make for extremely tight and focused boss fights.
"This Game has powerful visual storytelling and great atmosphere, the swordplay feels nice and is complimented by the various skills and special abilities, This game is like dark souls in some of its systems but in most all other aspects feels completely new. Sekiro greatly rewards those who stick with the game and push through the learning curve with great advancements in agility and challenges to how to defeat each of your foes. Dont be afraid to move through to another area instead of trying to fight one boss over and over. Sekiro rewards some exploration, and remember to grind for Sen to buy everything you can, you'll need it."
Does in fact have plin plin plon
The age of Man is upon us!
"Game is as much fun as the first but somehow does a few things people will ultimately find annoying.
Owh and heed the warning the Steam store gives you, Play with a controller!
Trust me, you will thank me later ;)

After playing Dark Souls I i put this game on my wishlist, a little while ago one of my lovely viewers donated the game to me <3

I started out the game as a Deprived right away, noticed i still ended up with some gear in my inventory even though the game should (in my oppinion) start you out with nothing.
Spend the first 10 minutes killing stuff with my bare hands, this was entertaining haha.
Found a dagger soon after, then went to a Black Knight Halbert +3 or +4 i believe :P
(Totally loved this weapon in my DS1 playthrough).

As with the first Dark souls game the game does not really tell you where to go, you just have to find that out for yourself.
Personally i find this enjoyable. I dislike games that hold my hand while i play, i takes away from the feeling.

The areas look pretty good, don't know how they originally looked in DS2, because i never owned the game.

Some enemies will spam attack you to death when they get the chance, be aware of this.
Don't remember if DS1 did this, but i noticed it :P
The game will troll you if you don't watch out, which often leads to a quick death!
This is not really a bad thing though i laughed my ass off about a few of my deaths due to this stuff.

Also beware that the game is actively trying to kill you :P it won't care if it sends an invasion in your face while you're walking back to your bloodstain.
(sadly i lost over 75K souls this way so far, but it's all part of the game!)

After a while of playing i found a few things i disliked about this Dark Souls game:

The controller seems to have a mind of it's own every once in a while.
I've had a button active 3 times on a single press before.
My character regularly thinks it's in a ballet class and spins around instead of doing a dodge-roll backwards.
and sometimes (although rarely) something happens you didn't want to happen. (only happened twice to me so far)

The ""normal"" enemies will stop spawning if you kill them enough, this makes traversing certain areas a bit easier but at the same time it kinda takes away from the ""danger of losing it all"" element, which i kinda find lacking because of it.

Every game has this one area you wish the game didn't have, Dark souls 2? It has multiple.
Some of these are not really a challenge, but just DOWNRIGHT tedious and boring as fuck and the bad thing? one of them is close to a boss fight, better not die or you can do the entire area over again. 
Hint: It's not the enemies you should be worried about

Bosses seem a bit easier then they were in Dark Souls I, but this could be just me.

That said the game is still loads of fun, but comparing it to the First dark Souls game i liked this game less then it's predecessor.

Regarding PvP, all-round most people seem to have the decency to do a gesture before they start combat with you.
It's somewhat of an unwritten code of honor :P
i only got invaded by other people like 3 times and i never really enjoyed PvP so i usually just let them wreck me close to a bonfire :P

Where DS1 was full of hackers, it seems to be not so bad in DS2.

TLDR: Not as good as the previous Dark souls game, but still enjoyable.
P.S.: You're gonna hate poison in this installment!

Allows me to channel my inner weeaboo
Souls games are the best games ever created
the game really takes in what dark souls can be then turns it into a open world game
Completely devouring and freeing experience in such a beautiful world of artwork.
"This game feel less punishing compare to sekiro, but still nice experience."
"subpar souls game

still makes it better than the majority of games on the market 

play dark souls 1 if you want a great SOULS game

play this if you want a decent game

not recommended simply due to das1 existing"
"better than expected, but still wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't a hardcore souls fan

Shrine of Amana and Iron Keep are both a miserable experience.
The movement and combat simply don't feel as good as in the other games.
Most main game bosses were a pushover, DLC was actually pretty good.

It's hard to just run past everything in this game, which sucks for most boss runbacks.
Just make me start off with ""normal"" iframes, the first couple of hours were rough.
Loosing max HP when you die fucking sucks, the ring that caps it at 75% was my MVP.
I decided to just pull up a rough guide a couple hours in because I was fucking lost/didn't really know where to go, especially late game.

They tried a lot of cool stuff in this game, like changing up NG+, but just having more enemies spawn is a bit of a shit way too do it."
"Only died on the first boss 20+ times, best game ever."
"You think you're so funny with your ""Dark Souls 2 bad"" shitposts? I'll have you know that Dark Souls 2, released on march 11, 2014; is a flawless masterpiece and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. I would go as far as to say that it is fromsoft's best work, period. The fluidity of the combat in Dark Souls 2 and the complexity of the magic system is unmatched by any other titles that they have put out, and I would go as far as to say that they are far superior than every video game that has been made in the history of video games. Dark Souls 2, as the flawless masterpiece it is, adds innovative additions to the Souls formula such as Adaptability and the various combat stances, not to mention the precision of the hitboxes which were unprecedented until the game came out. The only game that came close to Dark Souls 2 in terms of precise and accurate hitboxes was Dark Souls 1, and that was only because it came before Dark Souls 2. And don't even get me started on Scholar of the First Sin edition; which added so much more in terms of replayability and variety in enemy placements, I would recommend all prospective buyers of Dark Souls 2 to purchase Dark Souls 2 and DS2: SOTFS separately in order to give FromSoft all the money they deserve for creating such a masterpiece. Dark Souls 2 is truly the greatest video game, so much so that it doesn't even require an Easy Mode because the players will be so compelled to play it due to the deep lore and innovative gameplay, not to mention its legendary status in the videogame world as being the greatest video game to ever exist. But don't get me wrong; Dark Souls 2 is absolutely brutal and will give your ass the clapping it deserves. Dark Souls 2, also known as Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin, also known as FromSoftware's magnum opus; is available now on all platforms excluding the ones that it isn't available on. So get yourself a copy, sit down, shut the fuck up, play the game, and actually form your own opinion before parroting off the baseless garbage you picked up by being a part of some shitposting clown community."
"Overall good.
Good PC adaption and graphics.
Good combat.
Good soundtrack.
But does it really have to lock the FPS??????
Is it just because that the producer doesn't want PC gamers have better experience than console gamers?????
Will change to recommend if one day they updated unlocked FPS,

Update on 9/8/2021
Okay it seems that they would never unlock the fps, but I solved it :>"
This game is amazing. A true challenge for those willing to face it. I would recomend for anyone in need of a challenge as you will spend many hours trying to beat this epic final installment to the series.
* V E R Y  G O O D * !
A great sequel that manages to improve on the first one while still remaining true to what the first one stood for.
The online aspects of the game do not work. This leaves it at a 8/10 instead of the 9/10 I paid for.
"So I played dark souls 2 on xbox and it worked fine! Good game and I enjoyed it, but I am a true PC gamer, so I couldn't wait until dark souls 2 came out for PC. I played through dark souls 1 on PC with a PowerA PS3 controller (shaped like an xbox 360 controller) and everything worked perfectly. The second I started DS2 on PC, I wanted to make sure the controls were similar so I could get right into the game!

The controls were different and that was fine, I was ok learning new controls. The problem is, I CANNOT CHANGE MY CAMERA ANGLE AT ALL. There is no way to change it unless I use the mouse or Keyboard, now being a veteran Dark souls player i know mouse and keyboard are gonna suck, It's way too much and honestly i'm much more comfterable on a controller. 

Now just to play 1 game that i already wasted 50 bucks on, I need to buy another 20+ controller just to possibly play it, assuming that controller isn't messed up as well? All my buddies with xbox controller say everything is working just fine. Why are you giving the players with a PS3 Controller the shaft?"
"This is NOT a game for everyone, this is a game for those that thrive in difficulty and hardship when it comes to games, not for those that will give up after the first block they'll hit and trust me if this is your first dark souls you will face a lot of road block, hell even veterans of the souls franchise had road blocks here, however we're not here to read my rumbling but for my review of the product so let's start.

PROS
1: Story reach.
2: The weapon selection and character classes.
3: The UI.
4: No hand holding to be found.
5: The graphics are still as beautiful. 
6: The game can be beaten in 30 minutes
7: It get more difficult the more you play (NG+ to NG∞).
8: The game has 4 endings.
9: You can use boss souls to get boss weapons.
10: The upgrade system.

CONS
1: Some weird lighting issues on the ringed city.
2: if you're running a GPU with more VRAM then 12gb and decide to downgrade to a prior version to the current 1.15.2 YOU WILL NEED VSYNC to prevent ghosting.


Yes that's it only 2 CONS what about it."
Sucks Balls smelter demon fucking sucks gay bby game
"I woke up.
Then I Died.
Then I woke up.
Then I Died.
Then I woke up.
Then I Git.
Then I Died.
Then I woke up.
Then I Git.
Then I Gud.
Then I Died.
Then I woke up.
Then I Git Gud.
And then there was first boss."
"The game is not that hard. What makes it actually hard is yourself. If you fight some mobs or bosses, just make sure you know the exact timing and their movement set. Like when to attack, and when not.

So, git gud scrub."
Would have been cool if they took the time to make the controls more PC friendly than just overlaying with XBOX controls.... really screws up the gameplay i think... other than that game is alright but nothing special.
"This game is good enough but with Elden Ring being out and this game being, in my opinion, the worst of the 3 original dark souls - there arent too many reasons to play it unless you are huge DS fan and can power through the BS. This game still has a somewhat alive PvP scene and it is better than 1 and 2 in that respect but...Just buy elden ring"
"Think fighting a boss is hard enough, try fighting three bosses at a time.. And if that's not enough, try fighting 6 goddamn flying fire breathing bosses at one time. Definitely worth the rage and broken space key.
11/10 would die again XD.."
"This game makes me want to smash my head into my keyboard.

For real, my honest review; the game is amazing. It runs very well on my mid-tier computer, surprisingly well even to the point I can even livestream it on Twitch! 

It's by far the hardest game I've ever played. Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 3, the entire DS series? They haven't got shit on this game. This game is for the real challengers out there.

I always find myself coming back to this game no matter how long the gap may be. Recently I've been more so on the grind about it (and even more so on the raging side!)

If you want sanity, don't play. If you want to buy a new headset or keyboard, or even desk, then this game is for you."
Like Dark Souls except there are two players instead of one.
"Shorter in length than previous instalations, but just as rich in atmosphere and challenge. If you haven't played any of the Dark Souls games, you owe it to yourself to give them a try!"
"Is Dark Souls 2 the weakest in the series? 

Yes. 

Did I like it more than Dark Souls 1 & 3?

Also, yes. 

From a game-design perspective, it's the weakest. It has the clunky combat of Dark Souls 1, with worse bosses, and an equal amount of bs level design. But there's something about the game that makes it so appealing. I'm a sucker for a good atmosphere and vibe, and this is where I personally think Dark Souls 2 is better than 1 and 3. 

I like Dark Souls 2 so much because it's trying to be different. Dark Souls 3 is basically a second Dark Souls 1 in terms of 
story, atmosphere, and vibe. The enemies in Dark Souls 1 and 3 are very similar, and you can tell it's made by the same director. 

As Dark Souls 2 is [i]NOT[/i] made by Hidetaka Miyazaki. It's made by Naotoshi Zin. And you can tell that immediately when loading into the game for the first time. I personally love the direction Naotoshi Zin was going for. He doesn't want Dark Souls 2 to be like Dark Souls 1. I mean, the game takes place an indeterminately long amount of time after the first game, and this shows in the area and enemy designs. As they're so unique. Take a look at the designs of Dark Souls 2 enemies and Dark Souls 1. There's a clear difference in vibe, and I love it. 

Dark Souls 1 is all sad and depressing, and I mean Dark Souls 2 is also sad, Vendrick's reveal is one of the saddest things I've ever seen. And generally it still has that Dark Souls vibe. But it's more bittersweet than bitter like Dark Souls 1. I mean Dark Souls 2's hub area is a beautiful coastal town that's bright and peaceful that houses a talking cat and a laddersmith? Which is certainly a strange profession. 

All of that's to say Dark Souls 2 is different, and I love it for that. It doesn't want to be another Dark Souls 1 like 3 is. And while it stumbled many times along the way, to say that Dark Souls 2 is a bad game that has nothing to offer better than the other titles in my opinion is very misguided and backwards idea. 

Give Dark Souls 2 a try. It might be a little dogshit at times, but that's all part of the definitive Dark Souls 2 experience.

"
"Sewer centipedes need to be taken out of the game, other then that, 9/10 fantastic game pls buy"
"I'm currently on like my 5th or 6th run of the game.  Already have all the achievements.  So yeah, I think I like this game."
"This is my first ever Dark Souls:

I enjoy this game a lot, but there are a few issues with this game for a beginner like me.
The game does not tell you how to control your character. Just some simple notes are on the ground to read how to do some stuff (light attack, heavy attack, etc.). Well that being said it was not a huge problem for me and could quickly figure out how to play this game. 

Next HUGE problem with the game: You fight some small enemies at the beginning and they very easy to kill, but after about 20 or less small foes you encounter the first 'boss' and there the problems start. My question is who the fuck designed this so badly? The boss is probably the most annoying thing in the entire game and does not feel right to fight against. It took me almost 2 hours to kill that bastard. This boss is not well designed in sense of difficulty curve. What I mean by that after this boss the game gets ridiculously easy. This boss should not exist in the first place, but after that the game is amazing and the next bosses are really fun to play against.

Another problem with Dark Souls 3 is that it does not tell you were to go. I know the design is that you have to find your own way, but after searching for minutes to find a hidden ladder that progresses the level is just annoying.

And finally the story of the game: Wait this game has a story? - In short, NO this game has no story at all sadly! I really enjoy the atmosphere of this game it is very dark and full of mysteries, but there is no story that pushes you through this game. I did not find any books, scripts or whatever to read, so that is really missed potential in my opinion for an engaging story (or for a story at all).

I think this game is not 'hard' it is quite easy, but that start is very poorly designed and that there is no guide feature at all with a missing story makes this game hard to recommend. Gameplay is fun and the skills and weapons are very enjoyable and make for an huge variety of playstyles to complete the game how you want to.

What I forgot to mention is that this game is a rogue-light at its core.

Oh yeah and the PVP, invading system is just annoying. So the best way to play is offline in my opinion."
"To the people saying this game is ""too easy..."" Either you're lying, or you should be doing gameshow competitions, because holy crap. This game is unforgiving. You make a bad decision, you're going to pay for it. You'll die, you'll come back, and die again. Eventually you get a foothold, or figure out your mistake, correct it and move on. It's satisfying when your plans come together, and it's relatively frustrating when they don't work out. Either way though, at no time was this game not fun, or too frustrating. From beginning to end, you're engaged in the story.
The controls are on another level. You've got tight, responsive controls that feel more like NES platforming than 3rd person shooters. Everything feels good in the hand (especially when playing with a controllers, which highly suggest)
Visuals are excellent, everything looks great. It runs very well on medium spec PC's from a couple of years ago, I run at 4k on an i7 7700k and an RTX 2070. 
If you want a challenge, tight controls, great visuals, and a great story, look no further"
dodging mechanics in this game on keyboard are absolute dogshit
it says shadows die twice but i think i died more than that not sure
"Controls are still as bad as the first one for M+K, controller definatly needed. As for wether its easier or harder, i wouldnt say its ether, its just different from the other dark souls. 

Tutorial is rather bad and doesnt explain anything but the basic attacks, They try to give some direction but at times it is way too vague and you can end up wandering in circles. 

As for graphics compared to the first, never dropped below 60 on max settings, and some of the views are genuinly plesant.

For fans of of the first, get it. For everyone else, i would say do a bit of research, if it looks good to you and appeals to you, its worth getting.

Bit of a dissapointment overall but its by no means bad, I would recommend it."
"I will quote the review that got me to buy Dark Souls many years ago...

""If you ever want to get laid again, don't buy this game"" - Random internet review in 2011."
"Absolute masterpiece. literally ruined the joy of any other games. enjoyed every death, every fail. its not a game for every type of person ofc. but it doesn't mean it's not masterpiece.
best game in the world, period.

And remember:''Hesitation is defeat, you hesitate you fail''"
PRAISE THE SUN!!! 10/10 WOULD PRAISE IT AGAIN. DYING IS FUN
Do I need to say anything about this game? Masterpiece is putting it lightly.
"This game is hard but not impossible. The combat is what really makes this shine, it is hard to master but really rewarding when you get the hang of it. The sound and animation when you deflect a blow is so satisfying. Combine this combat system with an interesting story, I could say that this is best From Software game I played so far."
"amazing game!!! 91 on metacritic, so no reason not to buy it !!!!
"
Femboy boss that is being vored Femboy boss that is being vored!!!
"I've always liked the Dark Souls series, the lore, variety of bosses and enemies, and of course the DIFFICULTY. You can build your character the way you want and the areas are fun the explore while finding hidden items. Definitely makes good YT content lol"
"Among my top favorite games of all time. It offers a challenging and enjoyable experience with a fantastic atmosphere. My preferred choice among the three Dark Souls games, I would argue it stands out as the most polished and balanced entry in the Souls series."
the only problem i have had with this game is the parry mechanich i cant get that down but other than that no death has felt unfair or unjustified then again i have beat dark souls 1 with fists only i would recomend to new players and people wishing to renvigorate their love for the seires
Emerald Herald: Bearer seek seek lest
"10/10 game. Combat is the best I've ever experienced. Dynamic, brutal, punishing but also rewarding at the same time. Game has a learning curve but once you master it - it becomes like a deadly dance you deeply enjoy.I would say best From Software game, better than Elden Ring."
"Took me 2 hours to get past first boss, PRAISE THE SUN!"
"Combat is great, setting is great, everything is great. 9/10"
"An intense soul game. 9/10
You will die. A lot.
But after you manage the mechanic and enemy movement, you will become better after each fight.
The story lore behind each character and the land is also a lovely letter. 
The sound and abilities effect is top-notch as well as the scenery. I just wish their would be a bit more places where the character can chill out for a moment. Like a shopping district or town people wandering around. 
Nevertheless, it is a highly enjoyable soul tittle."
"I am not sure why I haven't written a review yet, but yeah nearly 600hrs of play speaks for itself."
OH SHIT IM GONNA BUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS THAT GOOD!
"Start playing. Die a lot. Get mad. Stop playing. Repeat.

11/10 would rage quit again"
The satisfying ting of swords clashing is the only reason you should play this game
I spoke to a cat and it told me I smelt good 10/10
"Pretty nice game,
Beautiful landscape, amazing artwork, creative creatures, some unique characters and lore, all the dark souls games has felt like real games to me... 
The only thing i kinda miss is the random rpg element.. its like dark souls are more like zelda than diablo in this regard and its kinda anoyying for a  true veteran gamer like myself, dark souls has a few rare drops etc, but you dont really get that treasure hunting feeling because almost all the good loot spawn the same places, and its easily remembered after first playthrough,
nevertheless, the best way to describe dark souls is like a good book, but not one i needed to read twice.
DS3 gets 9/10"
"oh man this game goes bonkers very very good, best of the og dark souls trilogy

buy it"
11/10 got even gud-er
play if u are a man of focus commitment and sheer fucking will
"Great long story, lots of fights, can be easy to cheese some fights and other fights are genuinely difficult.  All around, it's a great game.  I started on DS2, glad I came back to play this one."
"i would only recommend this game to a specific kind of gamer. i personally have been playing through the series and elden ring. it does not compare well so id suggest starting with this one first if you wish to do so as well. overall i see why the people i know that love this one over the others are even bigger masochists than i am lol. honest opinion is if you loved ds3 then this game is not for you. lots of wandering through trying to find lore, without the ability to fast travel to some bondfires until later ill add. The bosses also seemed under whelming as compared to the other games as well which for me along with the other enemies seem a lil dishearting to continue to fight as its just mobs of easily parried or even ran past enemies. I played a cleric with a claymore  and kite shield, once i got havels armor its only difficulty was damage check bosses and the falls from not knowing the map and well tbh the controls being different. GET IT ON SALE and of course try to enjoy. Most importantly whatever you do... Dont go hollow my brothers."
"I used to play Tenchu series games starting from the PS1 era, this game was resembles Tenchu in so  many ways like the shinobi himself, the sengoku Japanese setting and the game features like using grapling hook, stealth deathblow, also the shinobi prostethic tools which is come in handy. the mini-bosses and bosses fight might be frustrating at first but once you progress and learn their movement it'll be the game you'll love.

i highly recommended this game for people who love to challenge their self, just be careful, you might be swearing too much.
now i'm addicted to sword clanging sound."
"This game while not as hard as the first will still test your patience and your skill. While a great game Dark Souls 2 lacks something which the previous game (Dark Souls 1) had. Firstly the soundtrack in DS2 is not as good the one amazing pieces in DS1. The Firelink Shrine theme brings out so much nostalgia and is so memoriable which DS2 lacks among it's musical pieces. The boss fights in DS2 are amazing and difficult however the repetitive ""Knight"" or ""Swordsman"" Bosses can get a bit annoying. One reason I probably found these fights to be easier in DS2 is probably because I played on launch day and could summon people which in DS1 I mainly played alone. I do not think that the Bosses in DS2 are easier however because there are more of them it can seem repetitive (Still very fun though). 
I cannot comment much on the pvp because again I played DS1 quite late on my xbox 360 and was not invaded very often. I can however say that the summoning system is a lot better and that there is a lot less lag. The only problem is soul memory which I hope will be patched soon. The actual gameplay is not as tight as the gameplay in DS1 however it is a godsend for players whom experienced a lot of lag in DS1 that the ease of backstabbing has been fixed. Also the guard break is a welcome feature due to the annoyance of turtling in the previous game. However, another problem is the innefectiveness of poise in this game which means I can guardbreak a full havel's no problem. This hopefully will also be fixed. Due to this being my first review it is more of a ramble, however I strongle recommend this game. Even though I have mostly listed it's faults, the game is still difficult and it is easy to put in 200 hours of time into it. Also if you begin to get bored there is always Fashion Souls.
I give Dark Souls2 a 4 out of 5"
Scroll back up and buy it.
this game is so hard I cant even get it to play
"A very good game and fun to play with friends, but kinda dead"
"[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]
DS3 delivers a great Dark Souls RPG experience more akin to the first Dark Souls than DS2. Fun boss encounters with a variety of builds possible. Would recommend installing the Cinders Mod to fix ""issues"" with base game like poise/making all builds/weapons viable. Be way of online play as you might encounter hackers & interacting with them may get you ""banned"" from the online matchmaking.

[h1]GENRE:[/h1]
Dark fantasy action combat (Souls-like) RPG 

[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]
If you're familiar with previous Dark Souls games, the gameplay for the most part is the same. You begin by creating a character and picking a starting class (e.g. Knight, Pyromancer, Sorcerer) with predefined stats and equipment. You progress from area to area killing monsters and absorbing souls from fallen enemies. At the world hub, you can spend your souls to upgrade your stats to make the build you see fit. Bonfires are scattered around and are basically zone checkpoints that you return to once you die, or you can teleport from one bonfire to any other bonfire in the world. 

You progress through the game by clearing zones and killing the zones' bosses, namely a specific set of bosses need to die before the game's final boss becomes available but you'll eventually encounter every other boss along the way. 

In terms of what is new in DS3 that isn't found in DS1 or DS2, DS3 introduces weapon arts to the game which are pretty much a secondary attack style/animation (besides from the L1/L2 attack) inherent in pretty much every weapon in the game. Weapon arts expunge the FP (blue) meter to use and therefore have a finite amount of uses like spells. 

[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]
The art style of DS3, like previous Dark Souls titles, is deliberately very bleak and oppressing. The world lacks much color and gives you an apocalyptic feeling as everything in the world is soulless and wants to kill you. The environments and game effects are nicely textured, the weapons and armor and unique and interesting, animations are great and give you a clear sign of what an enemy is attempting to do, and overall everything came together nicely. Some areas can get quite dark so bring a torch/light spell if you can't see so you don't get surprised by a mob lurking in the shadows. 

[h1]STORY:[/h1]
You play the role as the Ashen One, an undead who rises from the grave to fulfill the purpose of returning the souls of the  Lords of Cinder to their thrones in order to end the curse of the undead and end the cycle of the First Flame. 

There's a lot more going on that you have do discover yourself by reading item descriptions and listening to NPC conversations. DS3 has a lot of lore to be discovered and if you are highly interested, there are many videos out there that explain it in much detail. 

[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]
•DS3 feels like a return to form as most movement and combat animations are similar to the original Dark Souls. If you played DS2 and everything in that game felt/looked awkward, you'll be happy to know that's been rectified here.

•The game can be a great challenge for newbies and veterans alike. You are constantly kept on your toes on the lookout for possible enemy ambushes as there are plenty of deliberate item and enemy placements throughout the game. 

•Hundreds of weapons, armor pieces, and rings to equip and create a build from.

•The introduction of weapon arts makes weapon choice a lot more interesting as you can choose a weapon based on its attack style/specific weapon art properties.

•Boss encounters are unique and fun. Only a few are gimmicked to be defeated a certain way, but otherwise you can defeat them how you want: solo, with help, with swords, with magic, etc.

•PvP exists in the form of covenant-based/red-orb invasions where players intrude into other online players' instances and attempt to defeat them by however they choose to. There are also unofficial but more honorable PvP locations where players duel each other and usually abide by a set of honorable rules (e.g. no healing allowed). Technically, PvP is an opt-in feature as you can disable all PvP by playing in offline-mode, but that would also disable co-op viability.

• The Cinders mod is touted as the ""definitive way"" to experience DS3 as it brings into the game armors and weapons from previous Dark Souls games, fixes & enhances the poise system in the base game, mixes up enemy placements in the world/adds new enemies into previous zones, creates alternate routing by connecting previously unconnected zones, and adds in toggleable difficulty settings in Firelink Shrine to make the game even harder for the veterans out there. Did my most recently playthrough of DS3 as an all-around caster using Cinders and it was great fun. Gets my recommendation for sure. 

[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]
•Online play is a hit or miss. You can run into legit players doing some honest (or not so-honest but at least not cheating) PvP, or you might encounter someone who just one shots you (because cheats). This is a double-edged sword as interacting with hackers might get you on a banlist that matchmakes you only with other people that are also on the banlist. It's a slippery slope that I cannot provide much insight on as I haven't played online since 2016.

•When I last tried building a caster in 2016, I recall that it felt very underpowered/underwhelming. I don't know if casting has since been buffed, but playing as a caster felt comfortable and natural with the Cinders mod so you might want to use the mod if you decide to create a build in such a fashion.

[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]
8.5/10

A good return to the feeling of DS1 and a good departure from the dread of DS2. Solid RPG combat, a deep & engrossing world if you choose to look into it, and an overall fun time killing everything before it kills you.

"aight here we go :) its a strong way more accessible Darksouls ..it melts in between the old Demon Souls, Darksouls1 and some minor positives taken from DS2 .
The Level design is memorable (wich it wasnt at all in DS2) there's no spawn decay like it was in DS2 , and the Boss behaivor makes sense , trust me it does .Now theres  people out there saying , ""game sucks too easy "", trust me folks those are the ones incapable achieving anything without googling the solution.
Stay away from guides , walkthroughs and simular shit  and youll find urself in quite a serious challenge.
Darksouls 3 is well designed , tough to the bone as it always was . Its enjoyable and fun .

sidenote:
And to those who are complaining its too easy and it sucks , trust me those are the ones using every glitch ,every guide via google .Those ppl shit on every other game anyways ...because they feel like shitting upon everything"
"Incredibly polished and balanced game. TONS of fun. Actually not that hard for anyone of a certain age, I would say - anyone who is younger than 12 or older than 35 would probably not have much problems figuring out the core gameplay loop. Hear me out: As kids we've played _really_ hard-core stuff like Battletoads and those damn Ninja games - these reflexes come fast to kids. As a real adult - life-experience brings feel of pace, but on a different, more integrated level. So - strong recommend to kids and people who have come to grips with their Anima."
" Good game, good balance in difficulty and learning curve, take it from me (a person who sucks) the difficulty is fun, and you learn from dying. You can't just spam dodge and attack, you gotta have big brain and not suck- that's all."
"It could not be any worse if it tried. Repetition is the heart of skill. This proves it's also super boring. I hate Japanese games so much. This game is a perfect example of why: Last gen (ps1 era) game put to next gen graphics, awful user interface, repetition to the point of tedium, terrible level design, not one explanation of how to play the game (perhaps why instead of how would have been more informative) and no pause button for when i have to pee. Also its apparently online but all i ever saw was ghosts running around doing nothing and messages on the ground about traps 3 feet away in plain sight. Also there were bloodstains on the ground that showed ways that some random person died but not the cause, just the 5 seconds before they died and their death animation. I could go on but I think I would be beating a dead horse and we wouldnt want to try to one up this game at that. They have cliff sides to seemingly safe areas. That means you can die in the hub towns.

I was killed by baby pigs in the center of town that I didnt notice until I was dead for seamingly no reason. Upon retaliating for the confusion they caused, i noticed that the hit animation of my weapon went over the heads of the pigs. They also killed my fully armored warrior in 2 strikes, something the zombie warriors with swords could only do in 4. I decided to use a magician against them to right the wrongs they caused. It took 2 fireballs to kill an armored zombie but took 8 to kill the pigs. Little baby pigs. That is nothing compared to the boss that one hit k'oed my dude with zero warning, unlimited reach, needle threading accuracy and Looney Tunes speed.

This is when the full realization kicked in: These guys have a reputation to protect. Demon's Souls was a notoriously difficult game for the same reasons this game was. You die to idiot zombies all the time because they are not only everywhere but completely unorganized until you walk into their line of sight and then they suddenly display the organization of a SEAL Team. They litterally wait around corners in large groups forcing you to kite an entire pack or zombies/baby pigs/huge Hulk Knights back through the entire level you hopefully just cleared, otherwise things just get plain mean. The game has deadly hazards on the way to get milk from the store. Death is not a normal part of this game, its the only purpose for it. The ONLY difference from this game and the previous games is now when you die your health bar gets smaller until you have no health. It doesnt only want you to die but it wants to rub in the fact that it is only going to get worse. You don't play the game, the game plays you.

So in summary, I whole heartedly recommend this game. I love it so much that I am going to call Valve right after this review is posted and request that they not only give this game back to the person who gifted it to me but also remove all traces that it ever exited in the same space time continuum as my account, let alone my computer. I want all the acheivements that i earned from this game to be put in a special place, far from my account, to be protected forever in a void that resembles the spinning cube the badguys of Superman 2 were originally trapped in. Forever.

This isnt a game as much as a narrow pathway of pain and misery linked together with 2 button gameplay desguised as a 12 button mashup of repitition and repitition and repitition and repitition and repitition and reptition. It's so insulting that I wish i could punch the developers children in the face with the vague hope either they will learn the lesson their parents refused to learn 2 times before this and never let this hatred be repeated on a different generation of impressionable but stupid people or that it will at least feel really good. Plus, the children will learn what the game their parents made was all about. In short, Fuck You, Dark Souls 2."
Best game ever. Now on my third playthrough!
"Utter disappointment and just downright nasty, I could sit here and make like 5 paragraphs on the cons of DS2 but my main gripe is the lackluster approach to every aspect of the game compared to the grandeur of the almighty DARK SOULS 1, the last boss of the base game being a pathetic nito clone? hell yea man"
Absolute masterpiece that makes you hate yourself at first and then slowly fall in love with yourself again only if hesitation did not defeat you.
"Dark souls is hard. I will not lie. However, it is not hard in the usual sense. Dark souls is all about knowing how to roll correctly. Dark souls is without doubt my favorite game of all time, if not the best game of all time out of all games. This game has been called hard, unforgiving, relentless, but it has also been called a masterpiece. I agree with all of those statements. I started the dark souls series with the 3rd one, and honestly one of my bigger mistakes in life is not playing dark souls 1 when it came out. So when I saw a remaster coming out I was insanely happy. I recommend this more than any other game on steam. You can not consider yourself a PC gamer without playing this. I can't tell you how good it is with words you must learn that yourself. [i]As the prophecy goes: ""Thou who art Undead, art chosen... In thine exodus from the Undead Asylum, maketh pilgrimage to the land of Ancient Lords... When thou ringeth the Bell of Awakening, the fate of the Undead thou shalt know...""[/i] fulfill that prophecy and don't let Oscar die in vane.  You will die, but never worry as long as you don't lose hope that bonfire will always be there...waiting for you."
Buy a pack of paracetamol too!
"I enjoy this game. Its like a normal (shitty) game, but better. I r8 this game 8/8"
Very hard but very rewarding ! Great storyline as well!
"No feeling will ever compare to beating Gael for the first time. I literally stayed up till 3am memorizing his patterns and methodically striking him until he was worn down, god it was a fucking amazing fight, like most of the boss fights in this game.

This was my first dark souls game and it will always hold a special place in my heart. 9/10"
Not for the faint of heart. lot of fun playing and even better with friends
Good Gameplay! Good Soundtrack! Good Graphic
"3 words make this game a total piece of shit and easily the weakest of the three Souls Games: Shrine of Amana

Did you think Blighttown was at all even slightly difficult? Well take the annoying slow moving of the bottom of Blighttown and then add Monsters that can bleed you, countless enemies that shoot endless endless sorceries, and a bunch of melee douchebags that aren't affected by the water at all, all while taking out the one item from the original that could have possibly had a decent amount of use. Thisn one part of the game just ruins the whole experience for me.

At that point its not about ""git gud"" its about why is this even in the game? Its not difficult, because there are parts of the game with genuine difficulty that are excellent and that I love. This is just annoying and cheap because you ARE going to die over and over, whether you've played for dozens of hours or not. The whole point of the souls games is to learn from your mistakes, but here you can play flawlessly and still be totally cheaped out by just a lack of foresight into what really makes something difficult"
"oh man where to start!
this games is perfect if you like gameplay oriented games. theres not much exploring or story building. just pure epic gameplay. 70 hours in this game and im still not bored xD  a must buy!."
"Better and more consistent version of DS2 with some items beeing moved in other places.
Graphic is also retouched."
"Love it!
Hated it at first.... didn't like the fact embers were soo limited and was always worried we would run out and not be able to play together with friends but then it became fun once we racked up embers and killed our fair share of invaders!"
I have finally beaten Iudex Gundyr!
Be a wary of Great Game therefore Moneybags required ahead.
"dark souls 1 was better, dark souls 2 is just frustrating. Bosses usually gang up on u and just seem uninspiring and unoriginal. I still enjoy this game regardless and have beaten it twice on ps3"
Dark Souls is a great game and I highly recommend it.
"I have never liked any of fromsoftware’s games. I never liked dark souls, it was too hard for me. At first sekiro was the same, and after i kept dying to the same miniboss over and over again i quit, vowing to never come back. But i did, and im so glad i did. Sekiro is special to me, everything about it is amazing. The sounds, the environment oment, the animations, the theme, everything just works. Im not the kind to replay games after i finished, but for sekiro, i dont see myself stopping anytime soon. Im on my 2nd playthrough and it still feels like a new experience."
"I can't stop dying, but I love it!"
Every soul... has it's dark. YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Best game i have ever played 9.9/10
"Extremely difficult but rewarding.

Not for everyone."
"Time to feel your own helplessness.


굴렀잖아"
Great game back 4 years ago  (2017) and still a great game now (2021)
"So while I love the game in itself, I can't recommend the PC version in it's current state.
A quick search will find you hundreds of threads about how various hardware setups simply won't run the game at more than 20fps, with multi-monitor, integrated gpu and even capture cards locking the fps at console ""cinematic"" framerates. 

The short version, PC is very poorly optimised and even if running a solid 60fps, you can expect screen tearing on high resolutions. Until they fix the technical issues, my review is going to remain negative, as Fromsoft have been through this so many times now this shouldn't still be an issue. 
"
"I've been playing offline for the past couple of weeks so I'm only just seeing these online issue e.g  non legit banning and so forth. 
When it comes to the PvE this game is brilliant. The boss fights gave me those overwhelming feels of fear and triumph that that surpassed DS 1 and 2 and the difficulty of the last bosses were very well done. I was very impressed with the new environment and improvement in graphics. The normal mobs had a good variety of move sets that required a different strategy to defeat almost every time. It looks like the developers tried to expand on the characters in the story although I feel it could have been done a little better e.g more character developent in the second half of the game. Overal I give this game a 8/10 taking into the consideration the previous games. (remember this is just offline play if your keen for online you should probs wait for some fixes)
I would also like to mention that new game + is a piece of ****. There are no new enemy placements, surprises, move sets just an increase in health so I wouldn't bother with that. 0/10 for effort shame on you developers."
"Fantastic RPG. Combat is impeccable. Can't recommend it enough for a fan of the series, or anyone looking for a challenge"
"One of the most fun games I have ever played, I honestly wish there was a fourth one. Both expansions are well worth the money and the lore is amazing."
love it when you finally beat vordt and bust your nut at the same time and then you can go meat the hot grandma in the cathedral #FakeChurch
Easily the most genius level and game design out there
Sign said finger but hole 10/10
"If you like challenge and frustration then this is your game. It has epic boss fights, a pretty deep story (that is connected to previous Dark Souls games of course) and a awesome soundtrack.
Maybe the only bad thing about the game is that ithas some bugs still, tho it's nothing that can break the game (but that can break you for sure).
It's also replayable, and it gets harder the more you replay it, and with each replay you can complete different quests for the different characters that you will find in the game.
If you haven't played the previous Dark Souls game then I highly advise you to do it, since the story, as i said previously, is connected to those other games. And if you wonder if it's worth to play the previous ones then let me tell you that it's totally worth your time."
"After multiple false starts, I finally got the 'dance' veteran players talk about. Rather than using stealth, throw yourself heedlessly into combat and don't fear death. I want from playing hit-and-run to effortlessly overpowering multiple foes. Dragonrot, the main penalty for dying, can be easily and indefinitely cured once you unlock merchants that can sell Blood Droplets; they replenish once used."
game is good but way too much overpriced and they keep increasing the price its 7 year old game and still on full price not recommended
Poorly done remaster you frame drop in certain areas and against Sif PepeHands
cool ninja samurai game thats super easy :)
"with this I finally played all the souls game and I can say that I am sad that I finished the story, I know I can play the NG+  but is something great about this games first time you play them"
Game of the Year .   So Great
"If you get anything out of my review let it be that YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A GAMEPAD TO PLAY THIS GAME PROPERLY... other than that the game is exactly what you'd expect from a dark souls title, your gonna die, get up, then die some more. the graphics are gorgeous, the story doesnt hold your hand, and the game overall has been streamlined. and the most important factor... THERES MORE ARMOR (that looks cool). overall, i'd say if you enjoyed demons souls/darksouls even a little, get this game...just dont forget the gamepad."
one of the best games ever made
Hard as shit and I hate it but still come back to play it.
"Really the ultimate action game, right now. For quality of combat, this is the one.

Just know that it is very defense focused. But, most opponents are playing by the same rules you are, which means that when you attack they also have to block and deflect. Unlike in other souls-likes, enemies don't ignore everything you do and continue their pattern. Enemies have to respond to what you do.

Ultimately, this is the difference between Sekiro and other games. In Sekiro you stand and face your opponent. You actually fight them-- as opposed to rolling around and hitting them when they're busy. You fight things face-to-face in Sekiro, standing up to them as an equal, and that makes all the difference in the world."
"I figured I should re-review given my experience gained since my first review.

[b] [New Review] [/b]

Definitely one of the best games I ever played. It can kick you in the aft end every now and then, but that's just how the game works. You eventually need to see the YOU DIED screen.

One of the hardest games ever made, and can definitely punish you in any way possible, but once you get the game down, it gets easy. Sometimes you have to be bad before you can GIT GUD. This game even forces you to git gud, makes you have to improve yourself, makes you get better over time. You would have to change your strategies the higher up you go. Strategies you use have to gradually evolve to adapt to the increasing difficulty.

Though the game is pretty much at the end of its cycle, there IS a modding community that's expanding the game every day, though problem with using mods, 95% of all mods can get you soft banned, and can only play with other modders, or even cheaters who have also been soft banned. Good thing there's an item in-game you can consume to unban youself...well...kinda. If you get hard banned though, sucks to be you. Either a cheater messed you up and got you banned, or you yourself cheated and got yourself banned. Just remember 1 key fact, never take candy from strangers.

The PVP is decent, just have to deal with Twinkers, gank squads, and the occasional cheaters. At least there is a mod to stop cheaters from ruining your game. A valuable mod and a must-have before you even begin to play online.

The jolly co-op is also great. People would definitely help you with any boss no problem. Any boss, any level, any area, anytime! Some people would also join you in PVP rounds, fight clubs and so on. Every now and then people would trade items, but I suggest being careful with that.

In the end, it's a fun game that can be played over and over again without getting boring. If the vanilla game gets boring, try a few mods to spice things up!

[b] [Old Review] [/b]

My first game ever of such type.

It was a pain to beat the first boss Gundyr, mainly cause i lacked all knowledge of the game, and couldn't understand the controls as they displayed Controller Binding Prompts, and i use a Keyboard and Mouse. I refunded it a few months ago, only to be convinced by a good friend to try it again. I eventually got tips from that friend, And i got lucky and won. I'm still extremely early in the game, still in lothric, grinding up souls with the claymore you can find there, an OP weapon you can get early in the game.

But after i don't know how many deaths against gundyr, and finally being able to progress in the game, I'm starting to be able to enjoy it!

I'll get better as time goes on.

If you played any other game like this, I recommend it.
If you never played a game like this ever, i suggest heavy studying before even thinking about buying the game, or you may have a bad time like I did...unless you got a friend to tell you what you can and can't do."
"The black sheep of the Souls games and perhaps the easiest, Scholar remains coated in lore with grandiose world building. Make sure to crank up the Adp stat, lest Aldia's rage consume you."
"This is the best game to have ever graced this earth... only in the first half. Its so beautifully interconnected, with so much love and passion poured into the game that i can damn near feel it through the screen, the second half-ish of the game has a MASSIVE quality drop and it felt like they just wanted to finish up with the game ASAP with re-skinned bosses, and terrible level design and inter-connectivity and almost feels like a chore. First half alone: 10/10, perfect. Second half alone: 6.5/10, playable once, never again. Total score: 9/10 (yes, the math doesnt add up, but it deserves it)

 overall, the game is amazing and completely changed my standards for video games in general.

 DONT WATCH ANY VIDEOS JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LOST FOR AN HOUR,IT IS NORMAL AND INTENDED."
"Ran around naked for 45min, got summoned, killed world master with crossbow.

11/10 would kill world master again"
"After playing all the games in the souls series, several times, including DS1 which I seem to have bought 4 times for me, and twice for each of my brothers. This one is my favorite, even though I played it less than DS1, I enjoyed it quite a bit this time around, maybe more than I did when it first came out,"
"great game, shame it's infested with people who just twink now at lower levels so when you're trying to progress through the game you get constantly invaded by people with endgame gear but with soul memory less than 40k, literally no fun to play against."
"Great game. Combat is faster paced than previous DS games, though a bit slower than BloodBorne. All around I enjoyed quite a bit, expect more of the same formula but with great graphics and smooth mechanics.

Praise the Sun/10!"
Best combat any game has ever had.
"The only game that's ever made me break multiple controllers. I love it, 10/10."
"This is my first souls like game, and I have to say, the boss is not the oponnents, the boss is yourself. After learning what you did wrong, anything is achievable."
"Me, Pre-Dark Souls III - ""Don't get the hype"".

Me, Post-157 hours of Dark Souls III - ""I AM THE HYPE"".

Excellent game, completely destroys any casual 'drop-in and play' mantra until you are familiar.

With boss fights, you go from dying out of frustration to dying in pursuit of learning their move sets.

Story-telling is intriguing and pleasantly reserved so that you may seek the lore, a nice contrast to many other RPGs.

Main game is entirely worth its original retail price, although ensure you truly engage the areas you explore as you may miss optional hidden gems."
Compared to the first two this one is really a lack luster experience and feels like a slog to get through where the first two games felt more like a difficult yet rewarding experience.
"After having completed this game 100% and played just under 200 hours of it, I can say with confidence that this is a good game. A good pve game. I have to make that clarification because frankly, the pvp in this game is quite possibly one of the most infuriating things I've ever had to experience. And it was required for a large majority of the time I spent playing it. The unfair techniques, general skill gap between most players, and weapons that seem to work for some people and not others simply because their skills are done differently is genuinely annoying. I've had quite a few ""throw my controller"" instances because of it. But I digress, the pvp is largely not necessary if you simply want to play through the story. The pve experience is extremely enjoyable, and it is of course a dark souls game meaning it's atmospheric to a point where it can bring a tear to your eye. I genuinely love this game, and I've played every fromsoft game there is. This is the only one I wanted to 100%. The enemy combat, the bosses, the secrets, the unique items, they all come together to make one of the most immersive and genuinely fun games I've ever played, and I've played a lot of games. I will likely keep coming back to this game whenever I feel down or bored, as I can pick it up at any time and go fight Iudex Gundyr and Vordt within an hour. But I can say with confidence now that I don't need to play online anymore for the achievements, that I will be playing offline from now on. I hope your gameplay was as good an experience as mine was, and if you haven't bought it yet, I encourage you to. This game deserves a 10/10, if you play it offline. 8/10 if you play it online."
"[REDACTED/] First of all, this game is super fun to play. That being said, go buy it on console instead. I cannot in good conscience give the PC version of this game a good review while I've had to press the reset button on my computer literally dozens of times to exit out of the constant hard freezes I get. It's beyond frustrating, because this is a really fun game. But with all these bugs that keep making my game freeze, it can be unplayable at times. Just fix your game, and I will be more than happy to give this otherwise super fun game a recomendation. I just can't do that in its current state. [/REDACTED]

Updated: Downloading a program to run the game in borderless window mode fixed all freezing issues for me. Really is a fantastic game, but the technical issues I was getting were driving me up the wall."
"I bought this game during the Winter Sale 2021, and I regretted it almost immediately. I didn't have the time to devote learning new skills and combat movements for this game, and I had limited time before I had to return to work. I severely underestimated how hard the game was until after the 2-hour mark for returns. At that point, I was denied a refund after failing for 4 hours against Lady Butterfly.

With all of that said, the game was incredibly fun and challenging. Some challenges felt challenging for the sake of being difficult rather than being rewarding, but there are more ways than one to cheese some of these fights. For how long this game took me to beat (33+ hours), it was not the game I should have bought. Nevertheless, I had to ""get back"" at Steam for not letting me refund for an easier game. Lo and behold, I beat it. I even got the ""True"" ending. To Steam Support May, I beat the game. I still wish I didn't sweat so hard the past 4 days to beat it and get my money's worth, but I beat it.

True Review:

The game truly is great. I watched many tutorials and videos online to beat many bosses. Sometimes I would repeat the moves verbatim and win. Other times, I'd find my own method for killing them (looking at the final boss of the game). I've only ever played and beat one other FromSoft game, and that was Dark Souls: Prepare to Die. The gameplay is incredibly different, and I found that many guides online had trouble transitioning to the combat style of this game from other SoulsBorne games due to the fact that this game rewards aggressive combat, and ""dodging"" is more about repositioning than it is avoiding attacks. It's all about being aggressive and staying close to the enemy 9 times out of 10. For some, this is difficult to overcome at first. I definitely struggled a ton to get used to the combat system as someone who does not play these types of games. I can only imagine how difficult it can be when you're used to rolling from an attack and not being locked onto from an unavoidable attack that you would otherwise be able to roll away from in another game. If you can get past that and learn the combat, it is fantastic. The art is fantastic. The characters are all ugly in the best way. The main characters look fine, but all of the minions and little grubs look hideous (I love it). The combat is very smooth and mostly unforgiving. You learn to build your reactions over time as you learn different movesets. I read multiple times that this game is like a rhythm game. Guitar Hero is much easier than this. Nevertheless, Taking your time and learning is what you have to do sometimes. Very rarely can you go into a fight blind and win instantly.

This game was great. I loved the combat. I loved the scenery. The story was interesting. There are many aspects based in Japanese folklore that I am unfamiliar with, and I want to learn more from playing this. If you're up for a challenge, this is the game for you. It's hard, but it's doable.

Also, you have to press the Circle button (B) on the controller and ""dodge"" forward to Mikiri Counter. Until I reached the last boss, I couldn't do it because I thought I had to deflect. Life would have been easier knowing this. It helps to read the flavor text and descriptions for moves in this game. Anyways, great game. Would recommend if you're into this kind of thing. It's not my kind of thing still, but I enjoyed the experience nonetheless."
"Never have I played a game that has captivated me the way Dark Souls 3 has. I am still experiencing and finding new things to this day. The graphics and the online mechanics are just so so much fun. If you want a game that hands you victory this is not for you. Like everything in the world of this game, you will have to push forward and figure out how best to handle to situations before you!"
"A classic masterpiece, the fighting style that created the soul games genre and revolutionized the game world."
If fighting a boss 20 times to learn their movement is fun for you then buy this game. For me this is not enjoyable.
"for the gamers out there, this is fo r sure a game!!"
please for the love of god buy the original version if it's your first playthrough
"my brother bought me this and i gotta say, this game is stressing me out. this is the only game that has ever made me scream to the top of my lungs. I LOVE IT!!!"
Do not go into the box boat its a trap
"dark souls but even more weeb.

miyazaki senpai outdid himself this time."
"The Dark Souls were the friends we made along the way
"
"Best played with a controller. The rest is a matter of skill issue and how patient you are. 

Play this game ONLY if you love getting hit just like how Darkness/Lalatina of KonoSuba does. ;)"
"Bought this for a friend hoping to to enjoy watching them go through the new player struggle. Turned out to be a souls prodigy and its 
terrifying. 
Now i have an unstoppable souls machine,
Worth it."
Its fantastic. You just get absorbed into the game
"Definetely more fun than Dark Souls 1. Where as the other Dark Souls seemed like stacked BS on top of more BS (Great game still fun), DS2 has more to bring to the experience and it doesnt seem too overwhelming. The seamless progression and continuous world and areas also helps with immersion and there's always a reason to play the game more.

FTW"
"A masochists ideal game series, 5/5"
"This is a great game. The character design is in-depth, the graphics are top-notch, and the gameplay is fun.
However, this game is not for players who will give up after dying a couple times. If you want to play, then you should prepare to die. The enemies will kill you. The traps will kill you. The holes in the ground will kill you. Make no mistake, this game will not take it easy on you. But when you are not busy dying, you feel like an amazing warrior or a powerful magic-user that can conquer the game world and become the new king of Drangleic."
Less hassle than using DSFix with the old version.
"Very, very, very poor controls and button configuration. I didn't do enough research to find this was a console game built around a controller. Even the UI is built around a controller. 

The game doesn't inform you about blocking in the button configuration. 

I started off with a single handed weapon but couldn't block. (Hint) I had to make it a duel wielded weapon and then I could block. Just wish it didn't take 30 mins of troubleshooting figure this out. 

I want to get used to it and I like the game. I think paying $15 was worth it. But without proper button and control configuration I cannot recommend for over holiday sale price.

And it looks like i've wasted my money because there's a ""new"" version coming out.. At least I didn't get a black eye during the mugging!"
"The Goal Is To, Grind Until Death. Highly recommended"
"This is the best souls game yet! Elden Ring is a close second! Also Vort's Hammer is my favorite strength weapon. Ooooh yea, recommendations...yes. The weapons arts mechanic is particularly welcome addition to this series along with frostbite weapons. Magic is still a mixed bag as far as practicality goes but it looks a lot better and works better than previous games. I hope the multiplayer make a spectacular return but I'd be surprised if it did. Still recommend though."
If it wasn't for the awful ganks in this game and those stupid dudes with the guns in the Sunken Valley it would be a completely flawless game
"Pretty good game. I've tried Dark Souls 1 and fell in love with the atmosphere and the story. This game does it in a similar fashion, but Dark Souls 1 did it best. I've heard that Dark Souls 2 should be the worst souls game which is probably true, but it is definitly still a pretty good game."
"Hardest game i have ever played, but i love it every time i boot it up"
"After recently playing Sekiro and having a blast throughout the entire game, I thought to myself ""Hey, why not give Souls' black sheep a try again"".

(TL;DR at the bottom)

So my experience with this title so far (PVE focused):
the first time I started playing, my controller didn't work properly. Actions where randomly assigned, some where missing entirely, and nothing could be reassigned. It worked fine in DS 1 and 3, but 2 don't like it. Oh well, keyboard it is then!
Except the preset keybinding are miserable, just short of unusable, but at least they can be reassigned. The developers didn't think anyone would actually use a keyboard, tutorial messages can only be displayed for the controller, and binding for example ""shift + left click"" to heavy attack is not possible, since shift itself is already in use for something else, dodge roll in my case, can't do that. Great. Double click for heavy attack it is. Well, and hitting guard breaks and jump attacks like this are inconsistent af, requiring several clicks, keys and an extremely awkward and precise timing.
Well. That's great. Let's start playing the game!

After this extremely rough start, it actually managed to win me back somewhat. I was having quite a good time, the presentation of the story was really cool, the characters had a lot of colour and character to them, the enemies were new and attacks were to be learned! But..
The gameplay started pivoting gradually. At the start areas where fun to traverse, bonfires were set adequately, enemy placements were well designed and versatile ect., and what you not expect from a good souls title. Though, more and more these properties started to decay. The same enemy was used again and again, completely spammed in their respective areas at times, the paths to the bosses became longer and longer, crucial bonfires got hidden away behind invisible walls with no indication, and the ""fun traversing"" turned very quickly into repetitious ""please just give me one more god damn attempt at the boss"". In some areas I've literally spend hours just to get to the boss again, to finally beat them on the second attempt or so, in total seeing the boss for roughly 5 minutes.
Many bosses are quite dull, ""left swing, right swing, pause, go in, smack twice, repeat"". Very few attacks are unique and memorable, changing up the gameplay in any meaningful way, making many rather easy to beat.
Spontaneously looking back, I can only think of one boss that was quite memorable as the only boss fight so far that was actually difficult taking many lives in the arena as opposed to the preceding area, and for its unique and grotesque (but fancy) visual design [spoiler] of course talking about The Rotten [/spoiler]. Everyone else kind of blurs together.
But what I DO remember are the areas before a lot of the bosses, very precisely...
For the majority the classical challenge from beating the boss turned into getting to them. And I personally hate this change.

I haven't beaten the game yet, but it's only getting worse. The word ""fun"" definitely does not come to mind while progressing, and the satisfaction from beating a boss turns very quickly from ""I can finally see new enemies"" to ""psyche, here's the same 2 enemies thirty times. Find the hidden bonfire, go!"". It's exhausting.

Combat is quite boring and repetitive in these circumstances. You single out an enemy, do a double hit combo, rinse and repeat. Attacking groups is a lot more interesting, though the risk of getting stunlocked to death in one of the many groups in between the vastness of boss and bonfire are tremendous. So the choice is, have fun but get demolished, draining said fun and your IRL soul without progressing, or take far more time than you wanted to, competing with imaginary snails as one's only entertainment, and just die several so much more excruciating deaths to unforeseen events, but finally greet that fog for a change, to fight a boss with one remaining estus charge!

Did I mention already, some enemies pull you out of the fog wall after two and a half seconds of the painstakingly slow animation? Oh, and there's poison. A lot of it. From puddles to stunning dart spam to enemies and last, but not least, smoke, complete areas drenched in poisonous smoke that you can't see through!
And there's a non-poisonous version with an increased vision radius of 3 generous meters (but with invisible enemies spammed everywhere, you can't have everything).

TL;DR
The start is definitely fun, but it feels like the quality is degrading rather quickly. While some areas are really well designed from a visual perspective, enemy versatility drops to rock bottom, their unique and thought out placements turn to just scattering them around at will for the most part, while the challenge consists of slowly grinding through the same mass of enemy just to get an attempt at the next dull boss, which in comparison to the path leading up to them is often quite easy.
I'm honestly a bit disappointed, and wouldn't recommend it, at least not from a PVE perspective."
I totally didn't die 200 times.
Pretty casual compared to 2. It lets you fast-scroll through the EULA.
Best game of the series. Can't wait for Elden Ring.
"HAND IT OVER, THAT THING, YOUR DARK SOUL"
The start of a great gaming genre. Recommend it to all.
Very nice! 100% worth buying and playing!
"As much as I missed the slower, tactical combat in the first dark souls... this game is a worth sequel, and frankly, the best souls game to date.

A worthy ending, to boot."
honestly my favorite game story is amazing will play probably 5 more times in the next couple months going to buy dlc soon to make the game all the better
"It is one of my favourite games. The music and the atmosphere of DS3 is one of the best parts. I recommend this if you love to learn and adapt while playing games. I've played through the game at least 7 times, the first run is bound to be awkward and terrible if you don't know much but you just need to learn. If you can, play it modded after you play through it a few times, switch it up."
Bought of Humble 4 days ago. Ill let the time played speak for me.
I parried a guy and he dced. 10/10
Well not as bad as I thought.
10/10 game. I hated it at first because I didn't understand the mechanics. Gameplay mechanics are really fun when you get the hang of it.
"Serinin gerekenden az ilgi görmüş oyunu. i-frame sabit değil, agilitye bağlı. Perfect bir souls."
"Great balance between difficulty and gameplay, the difficulty isn't forced and adds to the developement of progression. Lots of fun, though a controller is highly recommended. That's the only drawback I have really seen."
"Played Dark Souls 3, loved it. Heard this was coming out, and preordered it for Xbox. Played and beat it at least 30 times. Moved over to PC and bought it again. Fantastic game."
"Through over 12 playthroughs I have ""gOtTeN gOoD"""
don't level dex or i will hunt you
"This game is AMAZING.
its my first souls-like and i reallyu like the gameplay loop.
im playing it totally blind and the story is great to!
i love a game with good lore!
currently 14h in!
defenetly try it!
JUST PLAY IT ALREADY"
"Hate Squalid. Otherwise, decent spin-off."
"It's the best game I've played in my opinion. You can be a weapon man or you can have magics. Magic is rather difficult to make viable early game, but late game it's wonderful.

Each of the three DLC have enough content to be their own game. Get this. Play it, love it!"
"Dark souls 3's greatness speaks for itself, I will not sully its name with the praise of a pleb like me. NO MAN IS GREAT ENOUGH FOR SOLAIRE TO CARE

Dark Souls II: Prepare to Meh Edition

The third in From Software's series, Dark Souls II is unfortunately a turn for the worst from the previous Dark Souls. Despite an additional month to work on what they claimed was a game being designed for PC, there is hardly any major graphical differences and keyboard + mouse controls are an atrocity. Guard Breaking and Jump Attacks are nearly impossible to do, combined with the new ""double click"" half second delay on attacks this can end up leaving your character standing there instead of attacking, blocking or performing the correct attack. As you might imagine, this is completely unacceptable in a game whose core combat mechanics are designed around timing.

The world of Dark Souls II looks fantastic still. Locations are large and definitely lovely to look at. Unfortunately the weapons, armour sets, bosses and basic enemies are lackluster missing the creativity of those in it's predecessor. No longer is there the feeling of awe and enormity over bosses. Many follow the same attack patterns with only elemental damage being the real difference. No longer does the overpowering size, speed, design or lore leave an impression on the player.

Difficulty is less a manner of finding out timed patterns as overcoming mobs. In my opinion, it's a cheap way to try and bump up difficulty. Nevermind the fact there is a limit on enemy respawns now! That's right. Struggling through a boss? Let us remove the enemies for you and hold your hand walking up to the boss! Fifteen is the magic number for enemy respawns. I can only assume this was done to prevent soul farming but it's not like FromSoftware couldn't have kept the enemies in and dropped the soul drops to maintain difficulty.

PvP is something I havn't engaged in much personally. It's usually a 2 - 3 on one gangbang and generally not in your favour, especially in the Bellfreys. Servers are still up and down making connections and latency an issue still. 

All in all, Dark Souls II has lost the luster that made the series great. It's still more Dark Souls, but not in a way you might have hoped for. Best to get it on sale.

"The Remaster was a MISTAKE, so many things could be fixed, i am not talking of heavy things as the backstab fishing, but about the broken netcode, the marakumo weird and disfunctional hitbox, etc.  the invasions suck now that they are just handicapped, they can cure with estus but no humanity, people can gank with 3 phantom and if you want jackpot 5(npc like solaire) and this is just how bad the online is, if we talk  about offline The remaster is just 60 fps(and if you make less apparently the games slows, like an emulator) and nothing more, not 144 so F to those who spent a lot of money on their gear, the game texture are just cringe, some places that are further have polygons while the ones near you are just images, some textures are missing and you can see the void on the floors, glitches have remained unchanged like the weapons moveset trick or the place near duke's archive that makes you fall forever, i absolutely LOVE this game but the REMASTER is just trash work, the only good thing they made is the light effects and how it's 6.5 gb while the original was somewhere near 8 gb, so I wouldn't reccomend it, but thats the only version avaible on pc so nope, thats the only way to play it here(if you want the online).

P.S. the anticheat is the worst thing ever existing"
It has been more than 3 months and servers are still down. Even though it is a great game I can't recommend it at this stage as having a jolly cooperation with your sunbro is a big part of the fun.
"Its like dark souls, except very diffrent.

The only real similarities is that it's hard, i had a few issues but i'm willing to just accept them as me being salty. combat is VERY diffrent from dark souls so can't really compare it to that. i'd buy it and try it for 2 hours then see what you think."
This game really has one of the areas of the entire saga
"Although Sekiro is a FromSoftWare title, it is different from the other souls like games of the same company. You need time to familiarize yourself with its new mechanics and combat. However when this is done i think that you will agree with me that Sekiro is a masterpiece."
"Super fun if youre not a wimp and like hard games...
"
"One of the greatest games ever made. It is definitely a brand new experience, especially for new players. Dark souls is notorious for its difficulty, but I don't quite agree with that. Don't let that reputation turn off you off. This game is about always meeting new challenges, getting beaten down, then rising to meet it after learning from your mistakes. There is a unique thrill and rush of adrenaline you get from taking down a difficult boss.

Not to mention, the music is absolutely incredible, and really fitting for all of the unique fights that there are. Outside of boss fights, the world is silent and eerie; dead, or faded - which really sets the atmosphere for the game. All in all, a phenomenal experience."
"I
Will
Never
Play
This
Again.
Killed every boss, Some are good, most are average and a lot of bad bosses. ponyland is the hell you dont want to live in.."
"As of writing this, I have not played the game with any DLC or patches released with them. However, I cannot wait to go back and get beat down over and over once again.
Dark Souls II is a brutally difficult RPG and unlike it’s predecessor Dark Souls, it runs fantastically out of the box on PC. The combat, environment fidelity, boss design and user interface are all massively improved from the original. In my experience, the Souls titles provide some of the most rewarding experiences in gaming. Every move you make requires thought, planning, skill, patience and perseverance. Each obstacle you overcome feels like a true accomplishment and that thrill of conquering an impossible boss just drives you to push onwards. Dark Souls II in my opinion is one of the great games of a generation and is a must buy for fans of the genre."
This game is a very good game and has a decent story line. It is especially good for hand-eye coordination. I recommend you play this game.
"I don't know if it's me or SotFS it's easier than the vanilla verison? Back in the days i played the normal game on PS3, it was really hard to me, but now that i played thise one it was just... easier.
Anyways it's a good game!"
"Bastard hard but brilliant, the best FromSoftware game to date (and I love Bloodbourne)!"
"Fun Game, Better and improve from DS1, stable no frame drop issue. 
Gameplay still feel the same. and oh yes you gonna die alot boi 

9.5 out of 10. ( great )"
"the is pretty well made
the defense in the game feels satisfying and you need to defend a lot which makes a unique impression of the game and enjoyable
the game hardness is about understanding how defend works
when you know how to defend you pretty much mastered the game
i highly recommend it, no wonder it's the game of the year
"
This game ruined video games for me. 10/10 Would destroy beloved passtime again.
I never thought i would say this but i think i have found a Game better than Witcher 3 .....that itself is more praise than i could ever give !!!!
"DLC included, can run on crappy PC's. You have no more excuse to avoid the death."
"Great game, awesome online play, and awesome combat!"
"A great introduction into the series for those new to the elden-souls-borne-kiro series. There is a good amount of bosses and a good amount of challenge but plenty of things to help you through the game and if the game itself isn't challenging you can always do challenges, for example: No shield, Magic only, Hex only, Fists only."
"Amazing game may be difficult but it feels so much more rewarding when you beat it
PS: TREE SENTINAL IS AN OPTIONAL BOSS"
"What can I say about Dark Souls 2 that hasn't already been said a thousand times over? It's definitely not the best Dark Souls, but it's not as bad as many of its detractors make out. I'm told that Dark Souls 2 + DLC is a better experience than Scholar of the First Sin, and I can believe it. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one. Not as much, but you'll like it nonetheless.
I like the dual-wielding power stance mechanic and this is the best version of it except maybe Elden Ring.
I don't like PvP so I won't be saying much about that. It... works."
"It is great, it is beautifully, it is in some places difficult and it is magnificent, in writing, in structure, in setting. It's exactly what we wanted from the Japanese, what we want to play."

"PLAY THIS GAME

There is no better feeling then overcoming all the odds stacked against you in this game, espcially when you were stuck on it before. I would not call this the most accessible game every but this installment is probably the best at that out of all i've seen or played."
My ass is burning because of this game. Perfect
No words to describe this Masterpiece ...
i take it back this game is fun
this is like a special gourmet one time deal at the fromsoft restaurant where every other meal is the same thing just a different texture
I never thought id get killed by a pig until this game 10/10
"I like the way it hurts
-Rihanna"
"Great game!  Very satisfying once you ""git gud,"" similar to the feeling of learning all the intricacies of an NES game and being able to blaze through it.  Numerous ways to play means tons of replayability, never mind the new game+ mode.  Cool armor, giant weapons, big fire spells, all used to kill Dudes In Cool Armor and Scary Monsters.  Very dark, interesting lore as well if you care to look.  I recommend it to everyone!"
"I learned to love Dark Souls I, and Dark Souls II quickly became one of my favourite games of all time. I have invested 50+ hours into it (really impressive for a game nowadays) and I loved every minute of it. I found the narrative to be slightly more unbalanced compared to Dark Souls I, but it's still full of delicious mystery. The gameplay has some more finesse to it, as well as a better ramp-up than DS1. Unlike last time, the PC version is a superior release, boasting some fine graphics and a rocksteady framerate. If you are done with games that hold your hand, if you want to feel that special kind of rush and sense of achievement you used to get from games, check out Dark Souls II. Praise the Sun!"
"Great sovereign, take your throne.
What lies ahead, only you can see."

epic but some times not epic
"4hrs in and its worth every penny so far. 

Another great entry by FromSoftware"
A beautiful game that sometimes can be hard. But the grind is worth it. The game mechanics is excellent!
"actual physical real earthly proof you can never trust red people named after marlon bundo, mike pence's pet rabbit. funnily enough this man appeared while i was on a massive set of castle walls. POLITICAL GAMER COMMENTARY? make your own conclusions. 10/10 will get stabbed to death by alt right invaders again, recommended.


















































(actual review: game is pretty satisfying when you get a hang of it even if it rewards you with actual fecal matter. if you have a weak heart DO NOT BUY AT ANY COST)"
"NOT JUST A DARK SOULS SEQUAL!

This game is a beautiful blend of both the Souls games, both Demon and Dark. Welcome to a world where everything down to the very ground you stand on is trying to kill you, and most likely will. Differance between this and the other games. Easier learning curve as convenants make hoping into Co-op a 15 secons transition. Good times with the jolly cooperation by the way. You're able to study bosses with 2 others and find their weaknesses at your pase, plus you get souls for it! By rewarding players who co-op this is the best souls game there is."
A very fun game. You die a lot and you learn a lot. A true masterpiece.
"I always wanted to try Dark Souls. I watched some gameplays, and I really wanted to buy it, but can't afford 40€.
Then it was on sale, and when I saw it, I was like ""okay I need it, only 10€, and 3 dlc"".

So I bought it, played a bit, it was really frustrating. After 3 hours, I deleted my character, and started a new one. I played 5 hours with that, and after 8 hours of gameplay, I killed one boss. Only one. I felt so happy when I killed him, I tried it like 30 times, and oh my god, it was hard.

It's hard, so if you don't like really really hard games, I think you shouldn't buy it, but if you like those kinda games, I think that's the game for you."
"What can i say. Dark souls 3 is the best souls game by far for me!

Pros:
Gameplay is great.
Combat is better than ever.
Graphics are a big step up from dark souls 1 and 2.
The art is just gorgeous they have done an awesome job on this!
The world looks really beautiful.
Bosses are cool to fight.

Cons:
The optimization is not perfect, but it's playable for my rig.
Some weapons needs buffing / nerfing.
Bosses needs some tweaking i think. some bosses have too low hp?,  no big deal for now.

"I died..

And again
And again
And again...

BUT I STILL LOVE THIS GAME. 

Praise the sun 10/10"
"Don't listen to all the ""Git Gud"" shitheads who have no life, just ""Take your time and have fun""."
"good game i had lots of fun playing this good game
did i mention that this is a good game it is a godo gamo

"The Darksouls series in general is the best I've ever played! And I really love DS2. I've played all titles of the series, and definitely the level design of the other titles is mostly better than DS2, some design decision are really weird and inchoate, but the DLCs catch up again very well. Despite that fact, DS2 is a really great game! It has so many facetts which I really miss in DS3, f. i. the huge variety of weapons and ways to combine them, the huge variety of armor with very individual attributes (almost none in DS3), the variety of environments (all main locations are accesible from Majula by walking, like DS1, although there are some later locations where the connection is really strange), progress is actually quite non-linear (much more than DS3, though definitely behind DS1),. Many aspects of the graphics I prefer to DS3, like the detail of the character and the richly varying  coloring. NG+ has new enemies and is really a new experience. Many little gameplay details you would figure out only after playing it multiple times. In my opinion the best PvP of all titles.
Although I really love all the titles I've spent most of the time in DS2 (Vanilla + SotFS), trying out lots of different skillsets and weapons.
There's a big controversy about this title, from my point of view very biased. Many drawbacks would hold for DS1 as well. Nevertheless i can understand why some people who started with DS1 are disappointed with this title, since expectations went in a certain direction due to the great first title.
If someone is new to this series, my recommendation to be able to fully enjoy all the titles would be to start with DS2 (and play DS1 maybe as last title, for it is the most immersive one and has the best level and world design)."
Taught me dying twice is just as easy as dying once.
"good game, funny mods, majima everywhere a banger"
"Im not recommending this game. No way. No fucking way. This is a game for autists and people that hates them selves. Its only skill based to a point, and then it comes down to how much fucking stamina you have vs the stamina in the enemies pool, and guess what: They always have alot more than you. So there you are, spamming left trigger, jumping, falling down and spamming left trigger again. Sure, the game is really fucking fun when you are fighting normal enemies where its actually possible to counter and dodge. Some bosses are amazing too, but then the game just turns unfair. There are flying cunts that can change direction mid air. The hitboxes are worse than ever. The stunlocking is worse than ever. Sure, you have a grapple to use to fuck off with, but the enemies never forget where you are. Archers are hitting you across map even minutes after you went out of their vision, and that isnt just a friendly nudge. A ranged hit means half your hp gone. Ive never been angrier and more frustrated at a FromSoftware game, and I really love the BloodSouls games, but this game isnt fair. Its bullshit. ""Getting gud"" isnt an option because the rape-train just wont stop hitting you from behind for long enough for you to acutally recover and gather yourself. 

You are supposed to play as a legendary shinobi that cant die, but he has got to be the most worthless person in all of Japan. I swear my grandma has more stamina than this dude, and she hits twice as hard. Its like watching a fat child trying to defeat The Mountain only equipped with a stick. Also the fat kid has been smoking the last 12 years. And is missing its legs. And has downs. And here you are: trying to controll the shitshow with a unresponding usb-racing-wheel that decides to lock onto random walls rather than the actual enemies. 

They took Dark Souls, made it japanese and flashy, made the controllers worse. Made the hitboxes worse. Made alot of the bs enemies worse. Made the hitdetection worse. Made the grinding less effective and practically useless. 

Im gonna finish the game, but I doubt my controller will be able to survive until then. I want to like this game, and maybe I will by the end, but for now Im just left with anger, frustration and sadness every time I shut down the game, and that isnt worth it to me. There is no sense of acomplishment, just brief relief and then the shitshow starts over again. 

Unless you are prepeared to face these problems you should probably stay away from the game"
"Pontiffs a pretty fun boss, but I really liked the part where I thought I needed to fight the dancer first."
The black sheep of the Dark Souls Trilogy but still a wonderful game.
this game is so fun (: and so hard but i love it
"If you liked Demon Souls and Dark Souls, this is more of the same and you're probably going to like it."
Best Game I've played in 2019 probably gonna take the top spot for my favorite game of all time
This game ruined my life 10/10
The best game within the Dark Souls trilogy.
"I bought it for 20€ and i dont regret it, even though i have the prepare to die edition"
"First Dark Souls game I've ever played and I love it. It is super hard, but really rewarding if you are patient and learn from your mistakes. There are definately problems, such as with the hit boxes, but if you are willing to forgive these, it is an amazing experience that makes me want to keep going."
"pay a lot only for pain & die
am i masochist ?"
Most satisfying fighting system on earth
Best FromSoft game and one of the best games ever made. The PC port is top notch as well.
"Great game, amazing graphic, excelent lore, insanely fun (and rage) :D"
10/10 would trust again TRUSTY Patches nothing wrong with that.
"Hit table so hard - water bottle fell and splashed all over me, and my controller. Fuck this game, will definetly play it again."
Totally recommended for those who want a casual gaming experience!. I usually play offline so my playtime doesn't show my actual playtime.
"I think that if this game would get backstab mechanic like in darksouls 3, It would improve the quality of the game by 90%. Yes, Git gud is always the answer, but in my opinion, its quite stupid that pvp is literally backstab, counter backstab, and nothing else cause it's just too good to pass by because it's easy.

TL:DR = REMAKE BACKSTAB SYSTEM, and i change this review as positive.
I like the game and keep playing it but this is my opinion.
"
"Purity of soul, purity of mind, absolution - all this describes the player’s state after defeating Isshin."
"Currently my favorite Co-op rogue like in existence! The gameplay is super smooth and satisfying, the dash mechanic is well done, the abilities are super unique and have lots of combo potential with traits and other benefits. 

Has the standard roguelike progression where you get stronger over time, unlocking more skills etc.

I never ever ever write reviews but this game deserves one"
"Fun game,die more than twice :D"
holy shit dude this games sooooooooooooo much fu.....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
"Elden Ring
Miyazaki has done it again
The best soulsborne title and my favorite but 100% not perfect. It has issues and bullshit. I cannot recommend it enough. 

The modding scene is also gloriously rich and has insane potential. Check out 'convergence' and 'seamless co-op'"
with all the hours I put in I finally got past the main menu! [b]10/10 worth it[/b]
"Really excellent game with amazing visuals and music. The story is simplistic enough but has 4 different endings, no real change to gameplay depending on what you choose but mostly what bosses you will fight at the very end. Gameplay wise the parry mechanic is really well done and you will end up loving it or getting tired of it. Overall I really enjoyed the experience but this game is not for everyone. If you dont like ""Souls"" games you might want to try this one since the gameplay is nothing alike and has less ""BS"" moments than those games that are designed to kill you without previous knowledge of the areas you are exploring."
Good third release of the series but lacks extra content for ng+ and ng++ and ng+++ and ... which is very annoying.
"Probably one of the best Fromsoft game to date! Remember when you tackled Dark Souls for the first time and how vulnerable you felt? How you were just a scrub and had to ""git gud"" to finally overcome every obstacle? Well, you are basically back to this state in Sekiro. You will have to unlearn some of the things that made you good at Dark Souls by dying repeatedly. This game will break you to make you born anew, a better Soulsborne player. Not even Bloodborne managed this feat, although it was quite different from Dark Souls. Great combat system, you just have to push through the pain of the first 10-15 hours or so where you will suck at it.

Sure there is no loot or stats for your character. However, it is replaced by several skill trees and prosthetics upgrade trees that are quite deep and add many possibilities to your playstyle, probably more than what was available with just cosmetics armors and a couple of endgame viable weapons in DkSIII.

The art and atmosphere in this game is of course stunning, as expected from Fromsoft.

I couldn't recommend this game enough if you are already in love with Fromsoftware. If you don't know them though... You might be in for a rough ride, unless you are into punishingly hard games and feel rewarded by overcoming challenges."
"The mechanics are delicious.
The punishment is vicious.
Fromsoft, capricious.
The satisfaction almost viscous.

This is presuming you are able to make progress. It's hard, but beautiful. Fromsoft provide a true interaction with humility, and a sincere reproach for impatience. 
I still can't help but say yes, yes, yes."
one of the best game all time
OK. Game but the pvp is too broken :( you can not fight a decent pvp Fight :(
"DexFag is weak.

Change my mind"
"there exists no better feeling, more rewarding, or orgasmic feeling combat system in any game on the planet, the speed and smoothness of the combat flow so... so... well. oh fuck yea im starting to perk up just writing this review, gotta go back to the dragon lady and beat off brb"
10 dark souls out of 10
"I love this game, had it on the Xbox but recently joined steam so picked it up for cheap. Got it running in 2k  max settings still looks really good for an older game. Recommended."
"Definitely a hard series to get into, dark souls' difficulty is no joke. However, if you do manage to get into the series, you will want to play this game over and over and over again, it seemingly never loses it enjoyment, especially if you take the time to research the lore behind all the bosses. This game has some of the coolest lore I have ever looked into and will always be one of my all-time favorite games."
best game ever played of all time
"I can happily say after dumping 70+ hours into a game I didn't even have for a week yet, this game slaps. I'm so happy I've played a souls game, I enjoyed kicking ass and getting my ass kicked. The challenge was so enjoyable and felt so good to finally kill a boss I struggled with. There isn't anything crazy I can say about what I liked as I enjoyed almost everything about this game.

I just want so say I just disliked one thing more than anything else. The community interaction is so cool, but honestly when it comes to pvp i'm not a fan personally. About 90% of pvp is a player hanging out near enemy spawns and waiting for you, its just so boring since enemies don't attack invaders (A giant seed can be used but the tree does not drop them often and enemies agro on you wont care about anyone else). There were a few times id have a good fight or even a friendly player but sadly it was rare so its not impossible but you can get SOME good interactions. I got this game for the pve and challenge, not to have an over 10 minute long fight of a kid running away from me and thinking i'm stupid enough to get close to enemies so he can have an advantage which just results in us staring at each other and doing nothing for about another 5 mins."
"I've always wanted to see why everyone claims Souls series to be the most difficult of all time. Needless to say, I'm impressed. amazing creativity, vast world, different types of enemies, different mechanisms for every boss, long story and unmatched difficulty. A must play game for seasoned players with a knack for challenge."
One of the best games I have ever played
"Dark Souls II is a cacophony of shitty ideas, disgusting enemy placement, overly boring and stretched out boss fights, poorly thought areas, shitshow of a game engine and ENOURMOUSLY, and I kid you not, STUPID PLAYER CONTROL and endlag it suffers from it, yet, it somehow plays out a-ok, and has an endearing charm to itself which make you to plow through it in one way or other. To be able to enjoy this game properly; one must strip her/himself out of any hope and expectation and embrace the weird journey it provides."
"Game is a shitty console game. Menus and inventory are super clunky. The game devs have put 0 effort to make the game a bit more enjoyable on pc. 
""Git Gud"" comes from dying to enemies and learning their behaviour patterns. Enemies dont feel like real opponents. Combat combat mostly comes down to rolls and quick attacks. 
There's also a ""coop"" and ""vs"" mode but the way it's implemented is horrible.

"
"Every time I play this my face gets an inch shorter.

Really good."
games too easy gonna need a harder game to get past me
Well... time to be a masochist again.
"Great game. It's hard, but super fun and rewarding."
"Goddamn good game. Got into Dark Souls series with this remaster. Start with DS1:R and move onto 2 and 3.
DS3 you can't parry easily at all so, just enjoy it while it exists :D"
"- I bought an xbox one controller and now the game is playabe. I still recommend this game only for pc users with any type of controller, but now I can say that it is a good game and change my review. 

This is a game made for console and it's being sold to pc users without the proper adaptation (press A to run for example). I regret my purchase and if you decide to go ahead and buy it be warned that unless you have a controller you'll be scrathing your head a lot before you get the hang of the game."
"pc meta pontiff has ruined my life, burned my crops, salted my fields, and banged my wife. would invade there again 10/10"
Beat the game on Xbox loved it so much had to buy it again on PC
"inzane good game! made me break 2 xbox controllers. recomend everyone to play it ! not fun at all, made for and by rage quitters"
"You really want to ruin all other rpgs? Go ahead, play this."
"Finished the game, 
Got all the achievements,
Lost my sanity. 

10/10 Would do it again 

On a more serious note, DS3 has the best graphics and gameplay of the Souls series. Most of the bosses are excellent and the level design is pretty good but nowhere near the quality of DS1 , which IMO has by far the best level design og any game I have ever played, so it's a pretty high bar.
DLCs: - Ashes of Ariandel was pretty meh but it has one of my favourite boss battles of the entire series. Get it if it's cheap.
          - Ringed City was aewsome. Great new areas and great bosses. If it really is the end of the franchise, what a way to go out with a bang. 

It's one of the best games I've ever played and an easy 10 out of 10"
 I stood outside aldrichs boss door and jacked off to gwyndolins moaning
"If you really want to make an invading player frustrated, use a Silver Talisman to turn into a barrel, then laugh your as off as they run around like a headless chicken trying to find you, only to eventually give up and jump off a cliff.

10/10 Prop hunt is built in."
i beat it once and it asked me if i wanted to play again
"Fan-friggin-tastic! This game never gets old, hyped for #3"
I love this game. Im a late commer to the soulsbourne series and this has been my favourite so far. BUY IT
"This game is rather amazing although very difficult for me. All I want to say is... **** Pontiff Sulyvahn, I just cant beat him. >:("
"Colorful happiness simulator, but this time with no Miyazaki. 10/10 would die again."
"Level design is next fucking level and it's epic. Gameplay feels really clunky and the bosses feel a lot less memorable compared to DS3 but I guess that's expected.

Would recommend you play this before DS3 for the lore but also since coming from DS3 to this was somewhat of a nightmare for me personally in terms of gameplay.

Very good game!!!!"
This game will f**k you. But eventually you'll start liking it.
"You can tell this game has Miyazaki\'s fingerprint on it. Combat feels much tighter, akin to the first Dark Souls. The lore, bosses and level design are all well-polished. The PVP has a little bit of balancing to do, but that is expected. Great game!"
"I love this game so much. I Really do.. but i can't give it a positive review because of recent events.. 

Server have been down for about 3 months now and The games are still being advertised as co-op, but they aren't anymore. It seems as though the Devs are not going to keep the servers going, which, don't get me wrong i understand to some degree, but this game still has a big, active fan-base, so it doesn't make sense to shut the servers down.. unless.. they are doing it to make people buy and play Elden Ring.. The servers where shut down due to an exploit, but it was fixed very quickly.. why are the servers still down 3 months in? There has been NOTHING from the devs regarding this except ""servers won't be online until after the release of Elden Ring"" and it just seems scummy and sketchy.

There are some absolutely ridiculous people commenting defending the devs, asking why people are still playing Dark Souls 3 when Elden Ring is out.. It's such a dumb comment because they are literally different games, with different achievements, bosses, multiplayer aspects and the maps are different. Just because a new game is released, it should force people to stop playing their older games. Stop saying these dumb things.

It seems like once again, one of my favourite developers are just doing everything they can to make money, and screwing the consumer. I really hope this is not the case, but i can't give a positive until this is sorted out."
"An amazing game. The difficulty enhances the experience, and rewards you more when you reach the next bonfire."
I'm afraid you won't just die twice.
"They fixed a lot of the co op issues from the first game where you would have to wait 15 mins plus to get summoned or would have repeat failed summons. The keyboard controls are a little better than they were for the first game, but it still works best with a controller.

10/10"
"Update 2:
The game has had its online features restored, with the known security vulnerabilities patched out. 

TL;DR:
This game no longer has online multiplayer due to several unchecked critical security vulnerabilities that exist within every game in the series. The only reason Elden Ring is playable on PC currently is because of the events surrounding the end of life for all games in the Dark Souls series, and a small group of reverse engineers that pulled out all the stops out of love for the community and games.
FromSoftware has not released any statement regarding these issues.
Bandai Namco Entertainment, FromSoftware's publisher, is in the dark and does not know if the matchmaking servers will ever return.

REVIEW UPDATED 16/05/2022:
I absolutely adore this game. I have poured thousands of hours into it across six accounts. I have participated in many tournaments and battled my heart out in the PvP. I've played through the PvE in Co-operative Multiplayer many a time and met some incredible friends through the fleeting summon sign system I couldn't imagine losing.
Despite the game losing developer support shortly after a final emergency patch during the early life of The Ringed City DLC in 2017, I and many others continued playing the game with each other and against each other, creating dozens of large communities across social medias. I still play games and chat to the people I met through this game all those years ago. We do enjoy laughing about how unfair some of the things in the game are, such as Murky Hand Scythe and the Harpe, or any crossbow with Exploding Bolts.

Dark Souls III has been a big part of my life ever since the game was released, over six years ago now. I've done almost everything.
Towards the start of 2018, things in the game began to change. META weaponry was becoming apparent, exploits were being revealed, game-breaking bugs were publicised. Cheats ran rampant for years, prompting specific community members to release a free community anti-cheat and protection tool. Going online without running into a player running Cheat Engine in the background was practically impossible at the game's multiplayer hotspots. Due to the game's lax anti-cheat, cheaters had a kind of ""arms race"" that involved finding the most complex and dangerous cheat to use online. This arms race progressed for years, ranging from simple projectile parameter edits to cheats that got other, non-cheating players banned from the primary matchmaking server.
It went further though, as what was essentially the most dangerous cheat ever had been revealed; Remote Code Execution. This allowed a cheater to run any code on another player's machine. This opened up avenues of possibilities, giving cheaters the opportunity to steal credential information from every player online simultaneously, whilst also bricking their computers. Or, if the cheater wanted, they could Rick Roll tens of thousands of players at once.
There was no response from developers. It took years of reverse engineering to get to this point, and years of emailing the publisher and developers to no avail. Only when a publicity stunt involving the showcasing of Remote Code Execution and an unsuspecting live-streamer, only when it was [i]demonstrated to thousands of people[/i] did the developers respond.
Their response was turning off the matchmaking servers for every game in the series, as each game, from Demon's Souls to Sekiro, had the vulnerability. These vulnerabilities still exist on the console versions that still have online matchmaking servers.
A very small group of people, perhaps four or five, had been working together to document the majority of game security issues, so a sheet including everything could be forwarded to the developers. All of the issues given to the developers were patched in Elden Ring.
If the public showcasing of Remote Code Execution did not occur, Elden Ring would have been released online with these issues present, leading to what would have been the biggest disaster of any game that has ever been released, with millions of players losing data, money and computers.
The group of reverse engineers that discovered these issues were not paid. In return for solving these issues, they were rewarded with a ""Thank you!"".

It took the most dangerous security vulnerability possible for the game developers to act. They were silent for 5 years, despite innocent players being banned by cheaters constantly. The only thing they did to prevent [i]one[/i] issue was whitelist [i]one[/i] ban flag on the server end. This did not solve all issues as it was still possible to ban other players via cheats.

If you want to play this game offline for the PvE experience, go ahead. This game is full of incredibly atmospheric and unique bosses that are well worth the price.
It's just a shame the game series had to end this way.

( 2017 Original review below: )
[i] Points down [/i]"
This is the best game i have ever played
"There are two aspects to every game, learning to play the game and mastering the game. Most people want a game to be easy to learn and hard to master. This game is both hard to learn and hard to master if you are playing on a PC. There is no tutorial to teach you the mechanics of the game or the user interface, instead you get scratch marks on the ground that give you hints. The problem w/this is that the hints are for playing on an X-Box, not a PC. When you stand on the hint (the game calls them ""messages"") the prompt you get to open the ""message"" is geared for an X-box so on a PC you have have no clue how to read the ""message"". The only way to learn anything about the game mechanics (which button does what, how to attack or block, how to move, etc.) is to look at the key bindings. This brings up the another problem, two different actions which are important (rolling/dodging an attack and jumping) are both keyed to the ""space bar"". No matter what I tried I could never ""jump"", just roll/dodge. Changing either action to a different key doesn't help as the new key for the action won't work. 

The user interface (UI) is also hard to understand or manipulate. In the lower left the UI displays your ""ready"" tools/items. Of course the game doesn't tell you how to trigger them if playing on a PC or how to add a new item/tool. Again, I had to look at the key bindings to find out how to trigger them. After 13 hours of playing the game I still have no idea how to add to the ""ready"" items, the game doesn't tell you. Another glaring problem w/the game is an apparent lack of an in game map. If there
is an in game map, you are not told how to access it (there is no key for this in the ""key bindings""). Anyway, this is long enough. In conclusion, a game being hard to master is fine. Being hard to learn is not, I don't want to spend hours stressing over how to play the game, I want to stress over how to MASTER the game!"
this is the game that you hate to love. One minute you are having the time of your life and the next you want to nuke the world. Have fun!
"Excellent game, a little too easy though."
"love it BUT

1. a giant rat-dog, that jumps over you and do not touch you, makes you damage? (behind a secret door, so nobody cares) and the same rat-dog try to bite / eat you but doesn´t hit  you, BUT you get damage... 

2. in the whole game is just one enemy with an axe, on a chain. why? cause he is buggy as hell. he can throw his chain-axe, through every wall, like 15 meters far.
also in a hidden area. why keep a buggy enemy?

3. this black hentai tentacle ""dragon"" ghost enemy in the bodie of a lil undead zombie... is not only ugly shit, but very very poorly enemy-design

the first two points should have patched so long time ago... so CHAAAAAPUUUUUUH dark souls"
I'm dying left and right and experiencing so much frustration. Yes I love this game.
"Ok! This game and very VERY few others games had me click the ""New Game+"" button so fast that the game actually crashed! [This is the only crash i have ever encountered btw.]
But for real, this game is brilliant! 9/10! would give it a 10/10 but my feelings are hurting."
Awesome game if you like a challenge and like getting salty aswell.
"An absolute masterpiece. This game combines pure fun, rage, satisfaction, story, and difficulty all in one. With amazing combat, it makes you feel like your actually swinging a sword instead of the average games instant swing. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, making the game both fun to play and visually stunning. I am glad to say that this is one of the few modern games that doesn't hold your hand, and provides legitimate difficulty. If you're considering buying this I highly recommend it, unless you're not up for the challenge of course!"
Amazing advancement of the dark souls formula
"This was the only game ending that made me cry. I know there are hundreds of games with endings that are sad and depressing but this game didn't need to try. After all the challenges, anger and frustration you feel when going through the game and even beating the nameless king for the first time by yourself is just pure joy. But when it's all over and those end credits play, you get put in to a depressive like state of mind and reflect on everything, maybe even shed a tear along the way and smile at the end. But hey new game plus exists for a reason lads and time to do my fourth play-through.
Note: I played this game on console and did two endings on xbox and now I'm going to do my second play-through on the pc version and get a different ending..."
No Steam cloud saves eat my ass I lost 30 hours of torture
"It's not a bad game if you enjoy the combat, but to be honest I got bored. If you are looking for a dark souls like experience from the creators of dark souls, this is not it."
"Seems to be intentionally more punishing than DS1 especially at the beginning, but it does seem to ease up a bit once you have leveled a bit."
"Dark Souls requires intense focus. This isn't a lighthearted romp in a bright and colorful fantasy world; it's a methodical journey into the frightening unknown. And that's what makes it so riveting. Some games try to scare you with bump-in-the-night shocks and far-off howls, but Dark Souls doesn't require such predictable methods of terror. Its terrors emanate from its very core, each step bringing you closer to another inevitable death. How amazing that such a terrible place could be so inviting. The game's world is so memorable, and its action so thrilling, that it might invade your thoughts even when you aren't playing, silently urging you to escape the real world and return to this far more treacherous one. Dark Souls doesn't just surpass other dungeon crawlers; it skewers them with a razor-sharp halberd and leaves behind their soulless corpses."
ez game only died a lot
Massively Improved gameplay from the first 2 games.
"""Be wary of giant but hole""
10/10 would rate again."
I'm an atheist and this game genuinely had me looking to the Bible for help.
The boss fights are epic. The story is great. Perfect game.
couldn't finish it but its fine
"Pretty interesting game. Different from most games, creates a good challenge. Don't lookup stuff for your first time through. It's so worth it and the experience is like no other. Teach yourself to not get mad at death because you will lose alot and the game will be amazing for you."
"This game is a masterpiece.

Dark Souls took me on a journey unlike any other: one full of pain, heartbreak, and suffering. This game will feel unfair, and make you want to take a break for more casual games.
Yet there was also pride and accomplishment when a new enemy was bested or a boss felled by my blade.
Dark Souls made me put a lot in, but I got even more in return.

I couldn't think of a better way to be introduced to Souls-like games than the title that defined the genre."
ITS DARK SOULS III ............. DARK SOULS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its really hard but if you can get the hang of dodging its super fun. make sure to stockpile embers.
"PVE is good.
PVP is pretty good.
Nostalgia factor is a bit of a cop out (not complaining though)

Overall: 7.5/10"
"Dark Souls very good. Me like. You try, you like. You no like? You wrong."
"Great Gameplay, exactly what fans of the series expected."
"Man, I love dying 500 times and still enjoying it.

10/10"
Game sucks. Can't recommend it. Bitch @ me in the comments if I'm wrong. Tell me how to play it right.
"Been playing the series of years, and upon coming back to the Remaster has rekindled my love for the series. While the first game unpolished compared to the rest of the series, it's still a fun ""Play the way You want"" RPG that is very welcome for anyone who wants a bit of challenge in their games."
"The next comment could probably tell you how great of a game this is.
"
"Alright Miyazaki you got it ? A mini boss is just a stronger ennemie but nothing too complicated, keep the good stuff for the real boss alright ? 

Miyazaki : Yeah bru I got you 

Also Miyazaki : 
HOW ABOUT WE MAKE A MINI BOSS THAT REQUIRES A RARE USABLE ITEM IN ORDER TO BE DAMMAGED, THAT KILLS YOU IN 2 HITS BUT DIES IN 40, THAT SLOWS YOU DOWN SO YOU CANT AVOID ATTACK, THAT HAS 2 HEALTH BARS, THAT TELEPORTS BEHIND PLAYER, AND THAT HIDES IN THE DARK  !!! AND WHAT ABOUT PUTTING HIM 5 TIMES INTO THE GAME !!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
"amazing combat, great rhythm.
level design, enemy design is great too.
game feels ""compact"" sized, which for a quite unforgiving game is okay I guess, but of course, since i like this a lot i do would have liked to see more world building and secrets. i know, this isn't meant to be dark souls, it's a bit different with the style.

i think some part of the game isn't well designed; you can revive instantly after a fall, and you can only jump off the tree branches instead of using B/triangle/walking off the branch.
I mean, why make those things so stupidly fail-safe when the rest of the game is so punishing?
it sucks, like the popups. maybe this was to make the game more open to ""new players"" but really, it would ahve been better off. it could have been programmed to only have invisible edges during landing/grappling hook and then off, right? 
also, what is with the dialogue telling where to go? one of the great aspects of soulsborne was that it didn't seem like every other rpg, to tell you to do this, to there, you find him/her there, blaa blaa cliches.

The combat is still why I play this game, and i just have to deal with the new slight annoyances ""to make the game feel like it was from any other lesser-creativity AAA developer"".

Not sure if I can finish the game since the last two bosses i have in front of me are so strong, but is doesn't really bother me; i like to dance with the lesser mobs, so starting a new game a few times is quite good still."
"19hrs into the game bout 70% done base game and still got those DLC bosses maybe 4th NG run 
played close to 400hrs on PS4 so thats not a fist playthrough that was 55hrs for that but only base game 
DS2 is a brilliant game and will take a lot of time to play and find your playstyle 
plus the easist souls game goes to no# 3 not 2 (plus they're not easy games BY design)"
"I have successfully cleared my first Souls game. It was hard. Obviously. And took 5 months on account of how hard it was to motivate myself through it sometimes.
But now that I've made it out the other side, I can't stop playing. Immediately after beating the game, I started playing it again as another class. And I have plans that will last hundreds of hours, not even considering the game's sequels.
Which is to say, the difficulty of this game gets you invested, and combined with its truly brilliant design, I am glad to have conquered this game, and am happy I can do so again with the others."
It's like Dark-souls except the lore is understandable and Japanese. That's it. 10/10.
"It's dark souls baby, you know what it is."
"if you would like to develop Stockholm Syndrome, go ahead get this game."
This game is the reason I have a backlog
Very bad !!!! PATCHES HAVE SHOVED ME DOWN THE BRIDGE I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE CATACOMBS MANAGER !!! this is UNACEPETABLE
Best Game that i ever play so far.I dont wanna let the game end.
"The pinnacle of the serie ! And what a ride !
A lot of viable build diversity, less ridiculous questlines impossible to do without a wiki, the best boss fights of the serie (with my two personal favourites in the DLCs), more dynamic controls than the previous souls.
Its sole flaw lies in the linearity of its level design."
"One of the best singleplayers of the souls games. Definitely the worst multiplayer, though."
It's like watching your favorite anime and getting your ass kicked at the same time.
AWESOME GAME!!!!!! But amercians! stay on your own servers!!! You guys have invaded enough country's already don't invade europe servers you filty FAT PIGS!!!!
"Really good game. I am playing it first time with no guides and it isn't the most difficult, I find DS1 and ER to be more difficult. Also the Map can be confusing at times. But overall it's a great game so far."
"I absolutely love this game, I don't think I can add anything that hasn't been said already.  The games graphics can be a bit ""crusty,"" but to be honest I love how the game looks and feels.

My only gripe is that the game immediately throws you into NG+ after you beat the final boss, which I didn't know ahead of time and now have to run through much of the game again to fight the DLC bosses (which I was leaving for last as is typical with other games).  At this point, I'm just going to come back for the DLC after playing the other Souls games."
Grafisch tesamen met de Gameplay een indrukwekkende en uitdagende game.**********
"I've owned DS3 previously for the PS4 and have been a massive fan of the Soulsborne games since the first Dark Souls came out. The experience is enjoyable with the occasional dash of frustration, but who wouldn't experience that in a Soulsborne game? 

The lore to the game (let alone the series) is one that enticed me, with the lore showing standard players the surface of everything and slowly tempting them into an abyss of detail, the more you play the more you discover (even if you're going onto facing Iudex Gundyr for like the 50th time). Though by the end of completing the ""puzzle"" of lore, you're still left with questions that you're earning to have answered, which is what adds more fun and detail into this game, you want more! You would search throughout the games and watch videos on videos on the game to find the answers you've been looking for. 

As for controls on the game, I would definitely recommend playing this game with a controller, this would help face the struggles of input delays and make movements feel a lot smoother (however if you choose to do what I did, go through this game and still go through it with a keyboard and mouse, then I wish you all the best). 

The DLC is good itself, though I prefer the Ringed City DLC over the Ashes of Ariandel, game play wise they both play the same as the base game, however in overall build quality, environment and the enemies/bosses surrounding the areas, Ringed City comes out on top and introduces a lot more difficult bosses on top of the base game ones (have fun with Midir in the Ringed City). 

So to round it all off, this game meets my expectations of a good recommendation to others, this game will have you hooked onto the single player feel as well as the multiplayer experience (hopefully in the future I can give a better review that covers the PVP and PVE interactions with other players). As for now, I hope you catch this game on sale and I do recommend that you go about purchasing the deluxe edition to save your money."
From Software always does the same thing over and over again but they do it so fucking well god damn.
"Love the campaign. PvP is meh. 
If you're a single player person and you want to take it slow and explore, I suggest playing it on offline mode for your first play through and beating all the bosses solo. The biggest thing you'll miss out on are the helpful messages people leave behind. However, in subsequent play throughs I would keep it online because it is fun and intense to be invaded by players and also to engage in jolly cooperation.  
A lot of replay value with different builds; each with their own strengths and weaknesses. 
The DLC is really fing difficult."
i love this game it is so good 10/10 would recomind
"Game is amazing.  A must play for action fans.  I have it on PS but had to have it on steam as well. 
+Great game. Some of the best combat mechanics ever. 
+Great enemy art design.
+Performs fast fluid and flawless
+Music is amazing

I criticize out of love.  The game is a flawed masterpiece, but the flaws are avoidable:

-Camera is terrible. Its like the camera is a persistent enemy throughout the game.  No need for centering to exist in a game like this let alone be tied to enemy lock
-Enemy lock is another finicky thing.  The camera locks too tight and randomly switches to another enemy.  Doesn't matter if you can turn off lock. The directional movement isn't built for not using lock.  So you have two bad choices.  
-Enemies can sense you through walls once detected. Makes the game feel old and cheezy in these moments. This is a weird design choice as the clock for enemy awareness is generously short.  Would have much preferred they search for you longer and breaking sight actually breaks knowledge of your position. 

"
Really enjoyed it. Was basically Darksouls 1 except they took out the bad stuff and put in good stuff. Great game
"good game, many jolly cooperation. 
10/10"
This game is not developed for the mouse/keyboard and is only officially supported under the XBox360 Game Controller on the PC. The in-game hints and menus will only refer to XBox controller inputs. Prepare to be frustrated unless you want to memorize the entire key bindings for the mouse and keyboard.
"this game is wonderful thats if you like hard games, but for the most part it is very rewarding"
"Brilliant game. The Dark Souls series is always flamed for being infamously hard, but in the end it all comes down to discovering strategies to overcome the numerous (41 including the DLCs!) bosses. DS2 is great fun for both serious and casual gameplay (I've spent more than a few hours hunting down cool-looking armor sets to cosplay with). The combat system is intricate and offers a lot of variation and personalization once you get used to it. Online gameplay is unique in the DS series, and DS2 does a fantastic job of incorporating PvP and coop gameplay into the single-player experience."
its very challenging but fun to play at the  same time even if you die ever 2 seconds
"Dark Souls 2, dubbed the worst Dark Souls of the Trilogy. While this statement is very true this in no way means that the game is bad and should not be played.
If you were to compare DS2 to the other 2, these would be the main differences:
Longevity of gameplay- I haven't finished DS3 yet but I can already tell that DS2 has the most bosses and probably has more areas to explore than DS3. It definitely has more than DS1.
Armour&Weapons- There is a metric shit ton of gear and weapons to choose from. Half of my game I looked like Lucatiel, then I respect and decided I wanted to look like the smelter demon, eventually I found some sense and decided to dress like the king I am so I went and took vendricks set. I also went and grabbed the DLC crowns because at this point it had very much become fashion souls.
NG+- The only game in the trilogy were I was happy with NG+. Why you ask? Because not only did the bosses get harder, bu so did everything else. Some enemies had moved positions, other enemies had been added to sections and new red phantom npc's are everywhere. You can still speed through most areas with your game knowledge, you just need to be that bit more careful because you never know when 2 pursuers are gonna jump on your ass.
DLC- It has the most DlC's of the trilogy and are arguably better than the DLC's of DS3. I say arguably because The Ringed City is the best DLC in the franchise. The Crown of the Ivory King though has the best art design of all the DLC's.

The Bad:
Bosses (Lots of Bosses)- From Software fell into the trap here of quantity over quality. There are 30+ bosses in DS2, the majority of them being jokes or multiple enemies. No one likes an easy boss especially in a franchise where everything is meant to be difficult. Bosses like the covetous demon, the congregation, the giant king, hell I would put the old iron king
in here too, one of the main bosses of the game. When the boss isn't easy, they put multiple boss monsters. You can enjoy fighting not 2 gargoyles but about 5 this time, you fought one dragonrider early in the game- later on you can fight 2, I hope none of you decide to fight darklurker that splitting ganking asshole.
The point is that DS1 and 3 have less bosses but they are memorable bosses, when I finish this review the DS2 bosses are going to dissapear from memory. Except smelter demon.
Combat/Movement- This game has no fluidity, when your rolling, walking, even combat- it feels so bulky and slow, almost unresponsive. The best example I can give is its like wearing smough's set or havel's armour all the time, slowing you and everything else down. I played DEX build, a build around speed and mobility, no matter what I did I always felt so clunky and difficult to move.
This is my biggest gripe about the game.
I had no bugs, no glitches, no crashes- your kind of expecting at least one of these in DS, so I'm happy I had none.

7.5/10 Screw you smelter demon, and your blue cousin!"
"great, if you want to decend into great depression and never really get out of it :D"
"Difficult, but fun.

Concentrate on upgrades like regen and revives when playing with multiple people."
brb gonna go parry a car
I died a lot and I cried at the end 10/10
almost 400 hours in NG+4 invalid game data
"Just bought it because ds1 is gone of steam, but seriously if you ever played it with dsfix there is no point in buying the remastered"
"Firekeeper robes is second best top, first is obviously ur dad"
My favourite part is when the game crashes because yes
"fun hard but fun 10/10
"
This game while it may not be as well remembered as Dark souls 1 Is still a great game in it's own regard. do not go into it expecting just more of the same. it is more dark souls but it is also a bit of it's own thing. still very good tho
"My favorite FromSoft title for many different reasons. Only game I have ever spent $60 on and it was 100% worth it. Really freaking hard and different, so it takes a long time to get used to, but getting good at the combat feels so rewarding and all of it is so fluid I love it buy this game."
Probably my favorite game of all time :D
Looks like a great game! Except I can't play it. Constantly crashing. Much sadness. Hopefully QA personnel will be fired for releasing a broken game.
Still holds up against DS3. Great game
"All I heard for years was, ""DS2 is shit!"" compared to everything else. Finally, about six years later and seeing it on sale, I finally said to myself, ""I'm gonna dive in with no expectations and give it a fair trial."" 40+ hours later I'd say I've stuck with it enough to say I'm loving it. Since I've played the games severely out of order, I've found applying what I've learned forwards and backwards has been very helpful.

I am honestly mad at myself I didn't dive in to SOFS years ago. I'm not even finished with it and it may well be turning into my absolute favorite of the series. DS3 was my first experience with the franchise. There's TONS of lore theory out there about DS and DS3 and, from what I've seen, much less on DS2 and I really loved being able to dive in and have something much more of my own experience and think things over myself. I loved playing Cleric builds in DS1 and being able to get offensive spells for Clerics fairly early on in DS2 felt like a great morale boost for me because you feel like you're more of your class style right away.

The control feels super smooth for me most of the time and I honestly love that the world feels a lot more colorful and vibrant. Seeing how SOFS edition turned out honestly has me shaking my head wishing more effort was put into Dark Souls ""Remastered"" later on.

Bottom line is don't be swayed by some in the fan community for years like I was. If you haven't played it yet, get in there and get your own opinion."
There's an ogre on the forest of the Fallen giants. 'nuff said
"im gonna be honest with all you gamers 
i originally gave the game a negative review and complained ""dYinG rePeaTedLy IsNt fUn"" when i have played hundreds of hours of geometry dash on mobile and i beat cuphead a few times on console. the truth is im just very impatient since i dont really have much time to play games anymore these days and didnt wanna learn the mechanics of the game. plus i was forced to play with mouse and keyboard (since cuphead has taken the life of my controller). y'know the game wasnt too bad i thought it was pretty neato and after actually learning how to dodge and stuff i had some fun. except for the stupid lorian and lothric battle. it wasnt even hard i just couldnt beat it for the longest time because my brain is too smooth to realize i have to avoid the stupid magic orb things. highly recommended that you play this game. this is coming from a guy who thinks every game is bad. lol i thought pokemon sword is good so what do i know. if you like games that actually require the use of your brain you'd probably like this. so yeah thats my review of this game hope you enjoyed"
"This is my first FromSoftware game and it was BRUTAL at the start. I died SOOOOOOO many times you could call it Shadows Die at least Twice to every miniboss and boss. However, with each defeat you start to level up your own gameplay. Once you start learning how to deflect/parry and mikiri counter, this game becomes a whole different beast, with each fight being a dance between you and the boss. 

Beautiful animations, immersive voice actors, sound effects and unique OST every boss. Truly deserving of GOTY. Gonna try out Elden Ring soon.

Lastly, hesitation is defeat. 

P.S. Fuck DoH and Glock Saint."
KEEPS CHANGING MY ATTATCKS TO HEALTH GEM WHY
"Dark Souls Remastered is quite a fun game, while it is full of bugs, none being too game breaking, it is one of my favourite games."
"I like almost everything about this game, besides the fact that the hitboxes are really stupid sometimes."
"If you quit games easily cause they're hard, then this game is not for you!"
"Do not dodge, parry instead.
If you want to dodge, take note that the iframe window is very small and you cannot spam it in quick succession.
Came from soulsborne? Etch into your mind the art of parrying and turn it into a rhythm game."
"It's good, wish bloodborne was on pc though. :("
"I was skeptical when I first saw this game. I love From software, and have always supported them but this game deviated so much I was scared they had lost the magic. But man was I wrong, finally picked this up a few months after it's release and went onto 100% it. One of my favorite combat systems with engaging mechanics that are just plain fun, while still giving you that same satisfaction that you would get from other From soft games. I highly recommend this game to any fan of dark souls that is looking for something different, or anyone looking for a well polished and awesome game!"
"Mindblowing, they might tell you this is a hard game but it's not true. It is just belanced, if you die it is totally your fault. You have to proceed slowly, and if you can think about the enviroment you  can exploit it.

Interactions with npc are too hard to get by yourself, you'll miss some npc on your first run and there is nothing you can do about it, beside reading it on the internet. It shouldn't be so"
"If you're a fromsoft (Dark Souls 1,2,3, bloodborne, etc) enjoyer you'll enjoy this game 100%. Yes expect similar difficulty if not slightly harder cause no one can save you in this entry.

I'll just say stuff I didn't like. Felt like I had to farm attack power for the final boss. It was easy to do but still no other boss had such difficulty. Got a bit lost on where to go in one area but aside from that yea 8/10 the game is great good job fromsoft.
"
I still can't beat Iudex Gundyr
"Purification ending, all optional bosses.

For all that Dark Souls is touted as ""tough but fair"" (which it definitely isn't) Sekiro actually lives up to that description, perhaps because it deviates in key ways from the Souls formula. Where Dark Souls focuses on fantasy lore and dreadful exploration, Sekiro emphasizes stealth and high-energy, high-accuracy combat. Although the low-fantasy historical setting doesn't appeal to me, the levels are evocative and intricately designed. Sekiro's razor sharp encounter design repeatedly capitalizes on the emotional rollercoaster from ""this is definitely impossible"" to ""I have achieved the impossible!"" In terms of the apparent goals of the work Sekiro might be a perfect game. At the very least, I think it perfectly captures the ""ninja warrior"" experience while avoiding cumbersome realism or an overpowered protagonist."""
"what do i even need to write ? fromsoftware ,souls game ."
Just bought the game unfortunately the game doesn't give you a tutorial for keyboard and mouse and the game is pretty terrible to play on keyboard and mouse since the camera kinda sucks. so if I want to play it I have to go buy a controller. don't bother trying to play this game if you don't have a controller. still a cool game even if I cant play it right now.
"This is a game where you beat the boss when you are truly superior to them.  Is that after the 1st try, 5th, or 20th...only you can make that decision.  Because of  this, you truly feel amazing once you finally conquer the big baddy.  Gameplay is absolutely stellar.  You are rewarded for being aggressive and on edge and are punished heavily for not paying attention.  Gameplay is 10/10.  I haven't even mentioned the sound design or the art style.  Good god.  There are times where I just put the controller down, listen to the music and stare at the environment.  How can you not when a game is this beautiful?  Then when you're done smelling the roses, or in this case the cherry blossoms, you can go straight back into exilerating swordplay.  Seriously, buy this game, gitgud, and love it.  No other game is this rewarding of an experience."
"Aldrich's arrow goes BRRRRR

10/10"
"mmm yes, my monkey booze. I think I shall partake"
"It is really difficult, you need lots of skill to complete game... Luckily I posses a great deal of skill, so this video-game is no match for my intellect but sadly you will not be able to complete this title.
  / Skilled Gamer 47 (me)"
SO GOD GOOD MAN SUPER BRO AWSOME SWAG SWAG SWAG
"If you like experiencing great views, atmospheric music, and deep storytelling, all whilst being sodomised
then this game is for you.
"
"I love and hate this game it is so fun when you win but you want to die when the boss is about to die and has one health left but kills you
"
"Dark souls 3... I have owned this game for a total of 3 days now and i can already say this game is a masterwork, THIS is what Dark Souls 2 should have looked like. Everything is in its right place here, the story connects with the exploits of the first game quite well making refrences to the linking of the fire very often. The Souls mechanics have quite honestly been honed to their most refined point, with the game having weight like in Dark Souls but also being polished and clean like in Dark Souls 2. I really wouldnt wish to spoil anything of the plot so this is all i can really say about the game, take my advice, if your a souls fan, this will be the biggest treat of your life."
"probably one of my favorite games ever

the combat mechanics are just completly wonderful amazing, so smooth, satisfying and generally awesome. best combat mechanics in all Fromsoft titles thats for sure.

stunning graphics and soundtrack
love the japanese sengoku period type theme

very good story

very fun boss battles

one thing i wish they didnt do however, is that in ng+ after unlocking all prosthetic tools, upgrade materials is pretty much useless, ""no because you can use them to sell for gold!"" yeah well gold is also completely useless, im stocked up on spirit emblems, divine confetti, sugars, etc. and i just keep running around with 10k+ gold usually, with even more worth of coin purses. I only wish there'd be another way to use gold, like maybe a way to convert it into skill points, since its so extremely slow to get xp and get skill points. and also the cap on 20 spirit emblems is kinda low imo, but thats about it. 

overall extremely good game and i love it so much, especially after playing the game as Raiden from MGRR

11/10 would recommend"
"It's just not worth it. I dont have 4 days to waste on dying constantly just to have to beat a boss, in the most perfect way, who wasn't that interesting anyway. You have to be perfect just to progress right into another boss fight. Not a fun game....uninstalled."
I recommend it for those who love RPG games. but prepare yourself for a difficult game. you are really left among the accursed.
"Sekiro is a fantastic game and probably the best FromSoft game, as long as you like a rhythm-style combat system. 

This is a game that was made with a single playstyle in mind, so unlike other FromSoft games there is almost no build variety here. The main draw of this game is the combat system, a massive step away from the souls classic Roll-and-Poke technique, which now REQUIRES parrying in order to succeed. Along with other additions like the Kanji attacks, mikri counter, and posture bar this creates a very fast-paced, reactive combat system with extremely little downtime. Learning the combat can be tough but its worth the effort for how powerful and cool you feel wiping the floor with bosses who used to beat your ass. Aside from the standout combat system the sound, visual design and combat effects/animations are all top notch. 

The only real annoyances with this game are group fights, minibosses being surrounded by enemies (very time consuming to stealth kill), and the Demon of Hatred (Souls boss in Sekrio? Why?)"
"They are constantly updating it, and an overall really fun game."
"gets hate, still an amazing game"
"Very hard and when i say very i mean very, but that is what makes it so good, when you finally kill a boss you have been stuck on fore ages a good 7/10"
I LOVE IT A MUST HAVE
"it's a souls game so its not for everyone but it is enjoyable when you find chill players, just wish i could find the players i've met in game and add them"
Its like the dark souls of III
"I've not defeated the last boss yet after 50 hours and multitudes of attempts. This game is as challenging as it says; more so than its predecessors. This is an absolute must buy for anyone who enjoyed the original Dark Souls. It is absolutely oozing with nostalgia and i'm not going to lie it brought tears to my eyes a few times. Excellent playability and replayability, fun and rewarding multiplayer, and man, the art team at From Software really killed it this time. The only downside is that it takes quite a powerful gpu to run, but even with my GTX580 it is still playable. (If you didn't like Dark Souls 2, don't worry, this makes up for it!)"
"Fun game, lots to do, some stress but honestly if you have enjoyed any of the others, you will enjoy this, too."
best combat of any soles game ever
"got so mad i beat the shit out of a random guy
10/10"
"The devs have chosen to appeal to the more toxic types of players, and as such invasions are now irredemably fucked, and they have no idea what they're doing with the balance. if you're still interested for the singleplayer, just grab ds1"
"In a realm of darkness,
Where hope is but a dream,
Lies a game so flawed,
It makes one want to scream.

With clunky controls and gameplay,
And graphics that look old and tired,
Dark Souls 2 leaves much to be desired.

Its story is convoluted,
And its difficulty is unfair,
Leaving players frustrated
And pulling out their hair.

In the end, it's a disappointment,
A game that's not worth the time,
Better to steer clear,
And leave it behind."
"One of the best games I have ever played. 
Play it blind if you really want to have  a blast.

Just make sure you practice all the combat basics with the in game bot (I'd recommend flawless 50 for every skill, reset the counter if you miss even once). 
Once you're done with all the basic skills, you should have a lot of fun."
"Pros: has m'lady firekeeper 
Cons: Proof of a Concord Kept..."
"Such a nice game with excellent world design.
The mechanic was very interesting
Every boss could be beaten with enough time given to it.
Even if you not good but having a lot of free time will do"
"This game is harder than trying to get U.N. Repirations when fucking Donald Trump keeps calling my fucking bluff.

STOP CALLING MY FUCKING BLUFF. 

Because EVERY time you call my bluff it says: ""YOU DIED.""

FUCK YOU, I DID NOT DIE."

"
"I understand why people are upset with this remaster. It is just Dark Souls 1 all over again. However, there are two things that make this worth it.
1 - The revival of the online community 
2 - The native 60fps support.
Would it be nice to have cloth physics? Yeah. Would I like to run while locked on? Yeah. But from the beginning they said we would be getting Dark Souls 1 with technical improvements, and thats what we got. 

This game is still a masterpiece."
good game but fromsoft should have designed it better for example we should be allowed to warp from the  beginning of the game and they should have made humanities availiable everywhere honestly fromsoft has done much better with dark souls 2 and dark souls 3
10/10 would recommend its a really enjoyable game and it has a bunch of mods to enjoy as well!
"Dark souls 2 is good.
If you don't like dark souls 2 you a nobhead
shut up"
This is very good game. 11/10 would play again
"Original, one of the best, amazing music and art design, memorable characters, what else do you need? Everything is here. I regret that I did not try this game on release."
This game makes you FEEL like a shinobi severing immortality.
"I'm getting very familiar with the ""You Died"" screen. Great game though. Solar Senpai, please save me."
"One of the best action rpg's of all time without a doubt, made even better by a fantastic modding and online community. 

100/100"
"Has its flaws but is definitely a lot better than it´s made out to be. Weakest parts of the game are the enemy placements and the ADP stat. Best way to deal with the enemy spam is to just be patient and take them out one by one; Leveling ADP to 30 practically fixes the hitboxes so that´s definitely recommended.
Game has a lot of meh bosses when compared to the rest of the series, however also some of the best especially in the DLCs. 
World design ist good at most part although some transitions are really questionable (looking at you Iron Keep).
Lore, NPCs, weapons etc are on par with the rest of the series.

Game is INFINITELY more enjoyable on subsequent playthroughs (NG+ is also really nice)"
"Playing this game, I realised its not bad as I thought. It certainly does have it's charm, but i still think that it is one of the worse Souls games. However, this does not mean its a bad game. I respect it. 

2/10"
"Sekiro is all the encounter design and worldbuilding that makes From's other games (Dark Souls, Bloodborne) memorable, combined with a fast, fluid combat design that makes you feel every bit the master ninja.

For those who like From's world-building, the hallmarks are all there - interconnected areas, shortcuts to unlock, secrets and tucked-away gems. NPCs in the world have their own cryptic stories to unravel as the main narrative progresses. While Sekiro does have you returning to previously-cleared environments, as the story unfolds you will face new challenges. This isn't Dark Souls, where you arrive long after the world has stagnated - Ashina is filled with powerful people and agendas, a powderkeg ready to explode.

Sekiro evolves the combat of previous From games by making the player vastly more mobile. Dodge, block and parry (here, Deflect) are all there, but Wolf can also sprint and jump without limit, in addition to a grappling hook via his Shinobi Prosthetic arm. The stamina management mechanic is gone; instead, both player and enemies take Posture damage if they fail to Deflect an incoming attack, rewarding both aggressive offense and precise defense.

One caveat for the Souls fan: if you like the RPG element, you won't find it here. Rather than weapon/armor proficiency, you instead choose skills to learn and Prosthetic equipment to upgrade. It's a well-designed system, but not as far-reaching (or as dense) as Dark Souls' attributes page.

For the hundreds-of-hours player, Sekiro offers both New Game Plus and two (stacking) difficulty amplifiers as well as a New Game+ option. With four endings and a recently released Randomizer mod, there are plenty of excuses to come back for more challenge."
One step closer to Bloodborne 2 babayyyy
"Absolutely fucking incredible, I will never forget how happy this game has made me."
"[h1] Yay or Nay? [/h1]

Well...

Gameplay: Skill-based. Not for casual players.
Graphics: Excellent!
Sound and Music: Couldn't ask for more.
Story: The lore is very detailed and immersive.
Price: Worth full price if you're a DS fan.
Achievements: most of them will pop while playing, but some of them require grinding.
[h1] Final verdict: Hell Yay! [/h1]"
"I really like everything, love this game"
"Absolutely loved this game, my first Souls game. The only things I felt could be better are the camera for bigger bosses (just looking at a dragon's belly for the whole fight isn't that fun) I wish it could be manually zoomed out at times. And the ability to sort your equipment and make comparisons between equipment easier. Other than those little issues this was a near flawless game to me, 9.5/10"
"preety hard to understand at first but when you master the games mechanics it becomes one of the most satisfaying games to play and the boss fights are preety good and become even better when you master the games combat mechanics ngl miyasaki did a great job on this 10/10
"
Hesitation (to buy Sekiro) is defeat.
"A true masterpiece through and through. Beautiful areas that still hold up to this day, amazing and fun boss fights with great combat. Great graphics that hold up and an amazing atmosphere that is unmatched. Please play this masterpiece."
"Nice game, good progression, regular story, cool art

edit: I completed the game in alpha - since v1.0 is here I will update this review once I complete all achievements"
"Easily one of my top 10 games this decade for sure! Enjoyable, teaches you a lot of things (patience, problem solving etc), amazing art style and overall atmosphere!
"
You'll get hurt but in a fun way.
"Love the game but, I have a restriction on my account even though i didn't do anything so i can't play with my friends :("
"I've literally been playing the game for two days and have already had to ""remake"" 3 characters thanks to hackers.

Invading on low levels, inflicting curses that make the game nearly unplayable.

Honestly if they had a better Anti Cheat system I'd enjoy this game in its entirety.

If you're feeling like playing this solo good on ya, BUT if you want to do anything multiplayer you can forget it."
"its not dark souls 2

10/10"
I was continually pushed off a cliff by a large skeleton dog and squeezed my controller until I heard cracking sounds. For some reason I want to do it again.
"Man I got to tell you, it was perfect everything, down to the last minute details"
"Such an amazing game! Came in afraid of content lacking, since it's still early access. However, it has a lot to dig into, and full launch is soon. It's great to play with friends! The combat is really good, each weapon feels unique (5 so far, more coming), and there are a lot of skills and relics (items) to use and discover! Each run rewards you with something new, and there's still more to discover that I won't spoil here. This game definititely deserves your attention, especially if you're playing with a friend!"
Worthless! And NOT adapted for PC
Gravelord Nito will rip your anus open and you will like it
"I mean, it's Dark Souls.."
Luv me some dark souls [strike]CBT[/strike]
"Dark Souls is a game that forces its players to either become better or crumble, which is what everyone should thrive for in life as well. It motivated me for multiple things in the past"
"If timeless, challenging, beautiful story focused games are your thing then this is definitely the game for you.

From Software's hard work is very present in Sekiro: Shadow's Die Twice with near the same level of difficulty as Bloodbourne or Dark Souls while also providing a very strong and refreshing story and new mechanics. This game is definitely not for the feint of heart however as from start to finish this game will not pull its punches but does perhaps have more areas of levity than compared to it's other Souls counterparts. Sekiro: Shadow's Die Twice is gripping and if you're not familiar with From Software's formula of difficult games will definitely turn you into mush. However don't be scared if you're a newbie since challenge does not equal unplayable as this game teaches you the hard way just how to play it, even if you have to die once, twice, thrice or even... a hundred times. I highly recommend Sekiro to anyone who hasn't played any From Software games or is simply looking for a game to piss them off, reward, make you sweat or cry in victory when you finally pull off successful death blows and parry a barrage of incoming perilous strikes. Playing this game is almost guaranteed to make you look cooler in front of your friends once you beat it as well (Considering there are a number of endings to choose from). - Happy Shinobi Sword Clashing!"
A very hard game but if you like a challenge this game is for you.              pain
I killed the smith at the beginning lel
"Sick game, loved the fast paced combat which I enjoyed in Sifu."
dont play it if you dont have a xbox controller to connect to your pc.
"Not that good, get DS1 remaster, DS3 or Sekiro before this, if ya got a playstation play Bloodborne.

UPDATE: ok i dunno what happened during my first play through, it's still no DS3 but it's good."
"in the end, i got gud."
"To quote John Dark Souls himself:
""Everything is darkest before the soul.""
11/10, still has game breaking bugs and glitches."
This franchise is a fresh breath of air in a poluted market. Highly recommend the Dark Souls series.
Buy it again edition. There are improvements. Still just okay. Still recommend because I'm a weak human being.
"One of the most challenging and rewarding games I've ever played. Extremely solid combat, beautiful environments, and fantastic world building. Unforgettable experience!"
Very stunning game and the sword fight mechanics are pretty fluid
"C - Cool
U - Unique
M - Masterpiece

"I'm pretty late to the party, but for those looking for a helpful fresh review with high details im here for ya :D

Dark Souls 3 hype. Completely deserving. Probably one of the best games I have ever played. With that being said personal experience it wasn't as challenging as rumors suggested. Hardest part of the game is just learning patience again. Similar to the games we played as kids but compared to modern day games it just throws u for a loop.

Patience, controls, and learning the fights of bosses. Once u have all 3 you can beat every boss pretty easy. U'll learn eventually that moving into a certain position for each boss makes it much easier. To save time, Large bosses like demons u hug them close as possible. Human bosses u typically just hug their butts. Getting behind the human bosses is huge key to cutting their combos short or avoiding their moves completely. 

With all that being said the world is gorgeous and theres always something to look for. Whether it be a ambush, hidden path, or optional boss. Its all a wonderful experience. Theres the occasional jump scare to keep you on your toes but the world itself is little to be scared of. Instead youll become much more interested in why the world is the way it is and the lore is some of the best I've experienced. Leads u to understand it, but also leaves enough room to create multiple theories as to what could be.

The Role Playing part of the game is pretty great as well. Theres no one you cant kill, and character creation is spot on. Even the armor is spectacular. Certain boss make you fall in love? Well great news, you can typically buy the set for yourself. Same with NPC's youll run into. Along with weapons being unique and gorgeous in their own way as well.

Player vs Player. Sadly this isnt much of a thing in todays Dark Souls 3. There might be the occasional player invasion but nothing like what u see in older videos. Good news for those who want to avoid it and just enjoy the game tho. Simply dont use embers and after killing a boss just run off a cliff to lose the buff. Note: Some npc summons, to help with bosses, exist. Which you will need to have an ember activated to see them. Simply pop an ember before entering a boss room and look on the ground for any glowing white writing.

Lastly the community is to die for. Not only helpful on wiki pages, youtube, or other means. But also in the game itself you can find writing on the ground to give helpful tips on bosses, ambushes, secret paths and the occasional troll giving bad advise for a laugh. Or the occasional invasion and throwing some funny emotes to each other. Its all a lovely experience which im sure you will enjoy.

I consider myself to be a very hard critque but this game blew me away. 9/10 easy. Only reason its not higher is due to the NG+ (New Game+) experience. It's sadly the same game as before with nothing new but the occasional upgraded item. The boss fights remain the same with no new mechanics, just slightly higher health but u have higher dps. Still tho, the game itself is a master piece and anyone who wants a challenge i strongly suggest it."
"Such a good game. Beautiful and fun. Hard, but fun."
"Bring Bloodborne and Demon's Souls to PC

Editing to unrecommended unless PC servers are brought back online with RCE fixed.

Edit: Servers are back, editing review back to recommended"
"The best combat system from any game, probably ever. If it's not the best, it's definitely the most satisfying."
"9.5 / 10
Probably the best in the series."
best game ever lol just get it it is huge so much content so much fun so much customization so much exploration so much challenge (fuck comas)
"Restore the servers, it's been a couple of months already!
That's a scam!"
"The Dankest of Souls. 10/10, would play again."
"This game is amazing. I stopped smoking crack to buy this game, not knowing it was more time-intensive. The graphics are great, it runs smoothly, and the bosses spank you like the daddy you never knew you needed(except for deacons of the deep). It only gets more fun when you engage in jolly co-op where an experienced player carries you as you stand back and throw projectiles. When they inevitably die horrifically, you're forced to 'git gud' and fight like a man. The summary of strats for this game is a) pick a class and upgrade accordingly, and b) don't get hit. Its the kind of simple challenging gameplay thats engaging and enjoyable, not unlike a Bob Ross program. The easiest part is ragequitting, and many will, but stick with it and the seemingly bullshit challenges become fun, and that one boulder in the catacombs will never hit you again. 10/10 would play Herald class again."
"This is an amazing game with stellar boss fights especially later on, this is by far one of the most entertaining games i have ever played. Every boss is fair (except for spear of the church but we will get to that) and the skill curve was really well designed. all the side content, bosses, quest and secrets made the game feel lived in and gave a nice sense of exploration and satisfaction for completing everything and seeing your collection of bonfires and souls to spend on cool unique weapons.

The souls give a great incentive for beating endgame side bosses on NG + and onwards which is great and completing everything a second and third time is never redundant due to this and the extra rings you can get in NG + and NG ++.

There is so many approaches to finish the game and so many unique yet still completely viable approaches too, which is definitely a plus as it can allow you to spice up NG + by switching up your play style and weapons and makes starting NG saves after beating the game extremely entertaining as simply changing your build and weapons can make the experience very re-playable. 

The DLC bosses are really just the cherry on top every dlc boss (*cough* except spears of the church but we are getting to thaaaat) is extremely fun to fight and well designed, my personal favourite was dark eater midir the boss's patterns are extremely fun and exhilarating to deal with and the sound design is f*cking amazing. the visuals are also just top notch in the dlcs 

speaking of sound track the ost for basically everything in this game is just 10/10

the story and world building is genuinely interesting and cleaver (and also really depressing) and i never felt bored finding out about the world.

but there are some negatives in this game although not many I can't in good conscience not mention them:

1) there is a hack that invades can use to soft lock your entire save file for one character meaning you have to back up your saves constantly to prevent your character from being lost, I would heavily recommend you do this by going to C:\Users\[specific user you are loged in as]\AppData\Roaming\DarkSoulsIII, then copy the yellow folder which has the name of a bunch of numbers, paste this thing into a convenient folder and name it something informative about your progress at the time, if the hack happens to you bring the copy you need that you made and replace the folder in the actual darksouls3 location in your pc we mentioned earlier with all the numbers with the copy of your save file, you should rename it back to the numbers name that the actual file had and the game should be closed for saftey reasons. after all that you should be good.

2) spears of the church is the most stupid covenant in existence, there is no reason to use the covenant outside of getting more buffs to use in the covenant boss fight meaning the only people who get summoned into the boss fight are heavily prepared pvp players with pure pvp builds, this means the only way you have a chance in hell to beat them is to make sure you kill the painted guardian before the invader gets summoned which will be difficult if you are doing this at low soul level and even then most new players that reach this point will have to either resort to summoning as much as they can or just brute force it until they get lucky, this makes the rest of the dlc alot less accessible which is a shame because its one of the best parts of the game

3) covenant rewards are extremely redundant out side of getting them for achievements and it takes far too long to get them seen as their only value is these achievements, quite frankly the wolf ring having a +1 and +2 version makes the watch dogs of faron completely redundant outside of the achievement. 

despite these issues this games positives FAR out weighs these small ropy parts of the game and i would HEAVILY recommend this game to whom ever wants a fun and entertaining challenge, props to fromsoft for delivering a wonderful experience"
I love this! Take it and enjoy!
Not for all fans of Dark Souls games but still pretty fun. It takes a bit of time to get a handle of the different mechanics. I find the game to be a bit more fast paced than Dark Souls. Strongly recommend this game to any Dark Souls fan to at least give it a shot.
"Great game but same developer problems.

Typical FromSoftware game. Well designed, looks great, sounds amazing, exceedingly difficult, amazing gameplay. Unfortunately this also means poor netcode, poor PC optimization and performance, inconsistent framerate, and typical FromSoftware anti-cheat and ban system. If you played DS2 at release, You pretty much know what to expect.

Now for the actual gameplay. This game draws heavily from content introduced in the first 2 Dark Souls games, while incorporating a number of Demon Souls and Bloodbourne gameplay mechanics. The art style and overall design of the game is somewhere between DS1 and BB. Map design is fairly interconnected but for the most part linear, as it was in DS2. Boss design takes a number of cues from DeS, with numerous bosses incorporating some gimmick that you need to exploit to win and almost all bosses consisting of 2 phases like in BB.

If you liked the previous SoulsBourne games, then this one will definitely be worth picking up. High difficulty, high reward, good replayability. Also you're gonna die a lot."
Threw controller through my wall. 10/10 Game. Would throw controller again.
"Simply amazing i am veteran to the souls series and i think dark souls 3 is the best one yet

it has the things i loved about dark souls 1 aka the amazing bosses lore and npc quest lines it felt new but also strangly familiar this is certinaly my new favorite game 10/10"
"Do not go into this game expecting Dark Souls, you will be curb stomped. Empty your cup, and learn the dance of swordplay. Juggling dodges, jumps and parries is very stressful at first, but once you get the the rhythm down, the combat is intoxicating.

The gameplay is about 20% stealth and 80% combat. If you enjoy the painful process of ""git gud"" you will love Sekiro."
"A near-perfect culmination to an amazing trilogy of games, I couldn't possibly recommend it more. I do however suggest playing Dark Souls 1 and 2 before this one, it isn't strictly required but there are numerous back-references and recurring themes that will get you a hundred times more enjoyment if you're already invested in the series and its lore."
"Warra banger definitely worth getting for whatever price, played 200 hrs on ps4 and like 50 on steam and still not bored. It's just a fantastic game!!!!!"
"Very easy to grasp combat mechanics but oh-so challenging game play. One of the more difficult games I've enjoyed playing as of recent. It's a locked 60FPS, however I never experience any frame drops or stuttering, it's optimized extremely well."
"This game is a manifestation of pain itself. If you're into that, this is the game for you. 

Also, the Character design in this game goes so hard for no reason. Like seriously, why does this armor look so good?"
"bosses are definitely quantity over quality but as for the game as a whole, I prefer it over the 1st, and prefer the 3rd over this

a pretty good game, nowhere near as bad as the memes make it out to be"
"tl;dr - If you haven't played DS1 yet - it's worth it, if you had, well... this isn't a 'remaster' actually, this is a paid patch. Poor patch.

Pros.
- Temporary returned online.
- Now you can connect to your friend without headche and third-party tools (you can't in the original game, so this is actually what you playing for if you already have DSPTDE).
- Now you can use items in bulk. Yay!

Cons.
- There is nothing new, not a single enemy. Only bug fixes and some new bugs... and a humble attempt to make awful console 'you-need-all-that-bloody-numbers-on-the-screen' Japanese-style UI better. Needless to say that except for ability to eat a pack of souls at once UI remains as horrible as it was but I must appreciate the effort. And paid for it. Yes, even if I did before.
- Cheaters. Really, the developer must google 'how do i cheat in DS' and do something against it.
- Ping problems. I didn't have issues like that in any DS game, even in the original. Honestly, 8 out of 10 are somewhere else when I attack them and this is really making me mad. And yes, I did check my connection. Twice.
- Slow-mo if your FPS less than 60. And you can't disable that new graphical features like better light or fog to improve FPS.

In conclusion, with this product you can see how From Software once again proved that their coders eat cks and that Namdai Banco showed how to squeeze money from fans."

The best game series ever made

"Seriously my favorite game of all time. If you haven't played it you should. I'm not gonna write an essay on why you should(although I could) but I am gonna say you wouldn't regret it. well I guess it's goodbye then, friend, and don't you dare go hollow!"
"The game's good. But if the rumors about the new ""enhanced"" version of the game that requires you to buy it in full price, no save transfer, different MP servers, and other exclusive enhancements are right, nah screw both the developer and publisher.

Post Scholar of The First Sin release:
They offer discounted price for the owner of Dark Souls II to upgrade to SotFS and the same price as the original Dark Souls II for those who haven't owned the game yet. If you guys are planning to get Dark Souls II, get the SotFS instead for the many enhancements."
"The three little piggies didn't make their houses out of straw, sticks and bricks, but rather flesh, bones and blood soaked armor."
"for me the game of the year, the series souls is amazing and the third game is the best one for me, get the best of game 1 and 2 and combined with new features"
Once you get a hang of it it's actually a lot of fun!
First pvp encounter was a guy with a big glub named shrek in a swamp.Good game would get raped again
"Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin(Sotfs) is a Third-Person Action-RPG
The Sotfs Version is designed for pc and includes all DLCs.
If you compare DS1 and 2 then you will see, 
that specially grafik and gameplay have improved.
Drangleic, the world DS2 takes place in, is big and varies 
between different scenarios, weapons, gadgets, enemies and bosses.
Personly I have to say that it couldn't come close to my first DS experience 
and the NPCs have no great backgroundstory compared to the first.
But in the end it's just like the first a great part of the infamous Souls series and enjoyable.
The DLCs, which are already included in this version, 
are pretty good and give a look at the the deceased kings of Drangleic and its land.
9/10"
"must play for any soulsborne fans. I love the visuals and gameplay nuances. to me, this is more challenging than any of the other soulsborne games."
Best game ever. Rolling required ahead :D
"Very good game, would recommend to people who likes a good challenge."
I want to punch a hole in my wall every time I play. I love this game.
"Give it a try, you won't regret it if you like combat-oriented games. It's a beautiful, open world RPG that you can play in any way you like. Huge variety of combat options, weapons, sorcery, you name it, with almost zero restrictions on how you can combine them. You may have heard it's a difficult game but the difficulty increase is gradual, and you can play it safe and take it slow if you want. It's also a very fair game, things always work as expected and when you fail it's 100% because you made a mistake."
"[b]Extremely recommended[/b]. This is how most games should be: simple, great focus in gameplay and challenging but not imposible. Most enjoyable if you don't read guides or watch walkthrough; this way you are forced to think of strategies, equip combinations and the such if you want to keep going.

The only negative point: it lacks the amazing atmosphere and great metroidvania-like feeling of the world of the original but it is still a great game. Also, akward mouse and keyboard setup with few costumization as far as I played. It feels that the PVP was greatly improved, it still need some tweaks tho.

As for this PC version, thought I had just a glimpse at it, it looks so much better than the PS3 one. The three four noticeable points were:

+Support of full HD, unlike the original Dark Souls port on PC and DSII on PS3. On the PS3 one, I don't know if its just me, but I swear you can even notice dinamic resolution changes sometimes, to keep with the framerates, it sucks.
+Unlocked framerate, I played it at 60fps unlike the 30fps of the PS3 version.
+Higher resolution textures. This plus the 1080p makes the game twice better.
-Akward mouse and keyboard configuration, I would play this with a PS3/Xbox360 controller.

Anyways, this is the definitive version of the game, the 60pfs alone make it feel so much better in such action oriented experience. I can see myself playing this one in the long term instead of the PS3 one, once I finish everything in that one I'll switch to this one for good."
"Doing this for a review; 8/10. Good, short and hard like a young stallion should be."
i installed it on another pc and it did not have all my saved stuff is this normal?
"Get Gud, game whop my ass harder than my momma, but overall i got gud. 10/10 masterpiece."

"One of the major tennants of the Dark Souls franchise, I've noticed, is not feeding you information. Or at least feeding you enough information to whet your desire for more information. It doesn't hold your hand, telling you where to go, how to find items, or even what items are in the game. All the design philosophies about Dark Souls are 2 things, in my opinion: Dick move, bro, and Make them want to learn. You learn what stats are good and how to utilize them. You learn what weapons are most effective. You learn where the illusory walls are, what boxes are mimics, what combination of Fire Resistance gets you through Iron Keeps molten lava areas. You learn all that stuff and you feel brilliant because of it. All those things happen to you as a player and to your character ingame. The game tries very hard to make sure you never feel like a God. You always feel like you have accomplished something when you win. It's not an achievement for completing a chapter or reading all the somethings. You try a boss a bunch of times, you summon some randoms or some friends, and then you finally beat it. And that feels amazing. Because you did it.

In the end, Dark Souls feels like it takes gaming back to it's roots, back to Explore and Learn about the world because we can't feed it all to you on this 8-bit cartridge and manual. It feels like it teaches you how to play through gameplay and ambience and visuals. And this is all in a good way.

You will hear people tell you it's hard, but there's a difference between being challenging and being hard. And this game is Challenging. You can figure it out, you can beat it, and when you do, as stated, you feel amazing. That's what makes this game so great for me. It has high replayability, good music, good hidden story elements.

10/10"
goat game cant wait for dlc
one of the best games i have ever played
Out of all the From Software games I've played and beaten. This one may be my favourite.
very very good videogame 10/10
i got killed by a fart monkey
Fuck me this one is actually challenging.
"I've beaten it at least 10 times by now, but it is still challenging and fun. 239 hours since I've gotten it a couple of months back.

Wife sometimes comes into the room, tastes the air and goes ""Wait... is this.. is this salt?""

Such a good feeling when you progress, though. Makes all the difference!
"
"It's fun if you're looking for that Souls-feel. I have to agree with most others in that this doesn't feel super faithful when you take 1 and 3 into consideration. It's got some fairly memorable boss fights, but they're scattered among a lot of smaller boss fights that just felt like artificial gates as opposed to an actual skill check. At least 2 bosses come to mind where, rather than a sense of accomplishment, I'm just sitting thinking ""was that really it?""

The change to how i-frames and potion animations are tied to the adp stat is definitely a weird choice and almost feels needlessly mean, even if it's pretty easy to dump a few points to make the stat worth it.

I would honestly say the biggest con this game has is the torch system. It just feels like a half baked mechanic that ends up being a nuisance more than anything else. Very few times does it become useful, and when it does it's often at the cost of messing with your build. 

Bottom line: It's a fun souls game at heart. Definitely not the best in the series in my opinion but it will still scratch the itch. I'm starting the DLC for the first time so perhaps those new zones will have me come back to update this review."
"Rather difficult, yet surprisingly forgiving. Once you accept that you will die, you stop stressing out about failure, and focus on improvement. Watching yourself actually ""get good"" is a satisfying experience I'd recommend to everyone. You might be scared, stressed, and inexperienced at first; but just appreciate the flow of the game, and watch yourself overcome each hurdle.

The loop of throwing myself against a brick wall, until that wall crumbled away, was immensely satisfying."
I cannot recommend these games to others in good faith
"PvE is nothing like Dark Souls.
PvP is a laggy chugfest nightmare where the only viable builds are builds that can kill someone in under a second to prevent them from rolling away 20 times and healing back to full life 20 times in a row."
"This game has not aged well. It feels extremely clunky when trying to move due to its 4 directional movement, its lock on system, and spell accuracy. I use a controller bc i played the game on console previously and the controls for k&m just feel weird. I have seen that there is a mod to make the game a multi directional movement but that should have just been patched into the game as a setting."
"I was first introduced to the Souls series when I saw some youtube videos about Demon's Souls when I was around 13 years old. The game looked really cool, and as I learned more about it I learned about its extreme difficulty, and was hesitant to get it, but during 8th grade when I was 14 years old, I went and purchased it at my local gamestop. I was nervous that I was perhaps too young to understand such a notoriously difficult game, but I loved every minute of my first playthrough. Thus, I started playing to the Souls series back in 2010. Since then, it has gone on to be one of my favorite game series of all time, and Dark Souls III lives up to the mantle of its predecessors. I'm not quite sure where I rank this one on my list just yet, but I will say that this game was an incredible joy to play, much more so than Dark Souls II. 

Much of what makes this game great is that they took what worked best about the other souls games, including bloodborne, and made a sort of ""greatest hits"" souls game. It has a quicker pace like bloodborne, the movesets of the weapons and the visual style is closer to Dark Souls I, and the game flows and feels even better than Dark Souls II. There are a variety of callbacks to the other souls games as well, a treat for those of us who've played all of the previous Souls games.The game has a great deal of secrets and shortcuts, making up for what was one of Dark Souls II's biggest flaws, although it doesn't have the level of complexity of the earlier areas of Dark Souls I, where a myriad of areas are all cojoined, but the areas themselves in Dark Souls III are all of great quality, and are far more atmospheric than those in Dark Souls II, and more along the lines of Demon's Souls, which I personally love. 

The consistency of the level design and art style is what is perhaps the most impressive part of this game's presentation, just as it was in Demon's Souls and bloodborne. As I mentioned, I absolutely love the crazy interconnectedness of some of the areas in Dark Souls 1, but even that game which is so well regarded by fans of the series does have some weak links in terms of level and boss design (Lost Izalith is just a terrible area), but this game doesn't have any standout areas or bosses that aren't up to par. There are some bosses that aren't great, but there's no bed of chaos or Dragon god in this game. 

This review hasn't been the most focused, as I've just been spitballing about random aspects of the game, but the key takeaways are the while it's not perfect, it more than lives up to its title and is an absolute treat to play. I'm currently doing a second playthrough while creating a faith build and still having tons of fun having logged nearly 60 hours at this point. Fromsoftware is at the top of their game in this title.

NOTE: Performance has been quite good for me, although I do experience some slowdown every once in a while. I had one crash the day after I purchased the game, but nothing after that. Also, I haven't encountered any of the problems with the anti-cheat system, but from reading the other reviews, it doesn't sound pleasant. Take my review as more of a review of a game as a whole from someone who hasn't experienced and of the big problems that some people have faced. Hopefully, these issues can be sorted out though. From my personal experience though I've had few issues with the game and most of my time spent playing was just me having fun playing the game."
What's the matter Gamers! Nothing left to Lose? :D
This is the flawed masterpiece. Once you start you will either quit quickly or progress through agonizing but satisfying gameplay and challenge.
"Hands down one of the best games i've played so far this year.

Great combat, very lille catering to the lowest demoninator and a good solid difficulty.

As with Dark Souls 1, the multiplayer aspect is brilliantly done.

Go buy it and play it, and die alot :)"
"Not for everyone, only the hardcore."
My personal favorite in the series.
Still a legendary game... highly recommended!
"Dark souls, learn to hate something more than yourself"
"At time of writing i am about 3/4 through the game, and am honestly struggling to enjoy it. For reference i played Dark Souls 1 to completion 3 times. So here are my take on the objective pros and cons to keep it concise.

Pros:
-Deliberate, timing based 1v1 combat system for the player's moves.

-Excellent performance on modern machines, (My PC is a desktop).

-Wide variety of gear and builds so if you like stats or just experimentation this is good.

-A lot of content, good or bad, that means you'll have stuff to do.

Cons:
-Terrible enemy hitboxes for both bosses and enemies that can kill you without contact with the enemy's actual model, or kill them without you actually hitting them.

-Excessive tracking on all enemies without exception (Save maybe 1 boss i can think of) that means they can adjust hits mid swing, making sidestepping attacks almost impossible and making all enemies fight the same, namely bait them, attack, retreat, repeat.

-Unlimited Enemy Stamina, meaning that many enemies (Looking at you Alonne knights) that can spam attacks at you without taking any breaks, meaning that getting a hit in is awkward at best. Combined with the tracking and the next point, this is very annoying if not difficult at times.

-Spam, spam and more spam is the name of the game here. In basically every area the enemies will approach the player in the same way. The player walks into an empty room, then 7 enemies jump them from all angles, each being able to attack constantly, doing a lot of damage and taking perhaps 3 or 4 hits to kill (2 if you use a good weapon or heavy attacks). Regardless this makes the game incredibly tedious as the combat system is not designed for group combat, and means you need to advance inch by inch, baiting out the next swarm of enemies before you retreat and pick them off one by one. One boss run has perhaps 15 enemies on the way, each taking 2 hits for me, and being able to 3 hit me. My build is not bad and i am not bad at Dark Souls, as can be seen in the:

-Laughably easy boss fights. I genuinely was relieved whenever i encountered a boss in this game because they were so damn easy compared to the rest of the game. If you strafe to the right and slash every so often you can easily kill any boss, and none so far hold a candle to Ornstein and Smough, Kalameet or Artorias in the first game, or even the flipping Gaping Dragon. They have too little health and very boring attack patterns, with some killing you only due to the the aforementioned hitboxes.

-Unresponsive game-play. Unless you level ADP, (Which the game does not encourage) the whole game, especially rolling, will feel as though you are walking through treacle compared to 1, simply because of stuff like a small delay between finishing a strike and rolling. Given the enemies are almost all fast and track with their attacks, this is just painful, and i even found the game easy despite this.

I could go on, but you get the picture, beyond the terrible functionality, other issues include
-Terrible enemy and boss variety
-Much less exploration than the other games
-Non-Euclidean Geometry but not in the good, Lovecraftian way, just the stupid way
-Non-existent plot (Your character has no clear motivation other than boredom)

And more, but if you've read this far and still think this is a good game, i hope you can enjoy it. It can definitely be fun to play and is probably worth trying if you are a fan of the series, if just to appreciate the others more. However i cannot insist more firmly, play Dark Souls, Dark Souls 3, Demon's Souls or Bloodborne before this if you're choosing, unless you want to play in order, because those are simply better games.

Thanks for reading."
"good, me like big sword katana game"
"What this game will do to you : stress you, anger you, shorten your life, make you unpleasant to your entourage, depress you, make you hit a wall maybe. Your hands will sake, your veins will be tensed, your head will hurt.

What this game won't give you : peace, calm, serenity, an enjoyable moment after work.

This game and the serie is like smoking : addictive, but really bad for your and your entourage.

I finished it by the way."
I cant get enough of this series.  It sucks you in and fuels an anger you never knew you had in you.
"If you prefer keyboard/mouse playstyle, go somewhere else. The controller controls are also too janky for me."
Played this for over 1.500 hours on Xbox One and its still a blast. Best Dark Souls Game after DS1 and one of the Best Games ever created. Go get it!!!
"Dark souls makes me want to do unspeakable things to myself whilst also giving me the biggest dopamine rushes i've ever had, dont play this game, its a drug, it will consume you"
Running simulator while other player invade your game
One of the greatest of all time
damn good game. cant recommend it enough for people who want a great challenge
FromSoftware's best game so far.
"Do not buy it from wish, you'll receive dark souls 3"
Great gameplay but I wish the online features would return
"A real great way to finish off the series, especially with the dlc, completed the game on xbox so i have good enough experience to review despite not playing it a lot on pc"
"First of all, this game is great. I love all dark souls games, and have all achievements. But if you can, get a PTDE key. The remaster isn't really worth the money. I continually run into bugs where parts of the world don't load, or where the controller stops working until I reboot the entire game... And all you get are things that you can just mod into PTDE as well. So yeah, try to get an old PTDE key if you can for actually less bugs."
the real dark souls starts here
Defeated an invader whilst disguised as some sort of lamp. 10/10
"I summon some OP looking guy with a huge sword,he goes through all the metal ninja turtles like its nothing and then gets killed at the start of a boss.

GG"
i love kissing men and praising the sun !
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Patches is a bitch and poise a must
and always remember in Siegmeyer we trust."
"I have played through this game twice now, including once through both the DLC, and I have to say, this game is great. 

For the core game, I never found myself loving the artstyle or many of the areas, with it being a touch too gloomy for my liking, but the bossfights are some of the best I have ever played in any game. The worst a boss can be in this game is mediocre, and that happens only a couple of times, with every other boss being really good with a handful of them feeling as close to perfect as I feel you can really get. 

For the DLC, I really didn't like the locations much. They reminded me too much of the things I disliked in Dark Souls 2. They're very ganky, cheesy and annoying. One of the areas even references one of the worse areas in Dark Souls 2. I can't say worst because they get so much worse than that. However the boss quality in the DLC is absolutely superb. Ariandel has one okayish boss and one truly amazing boss and Ringed City has one boss that isn't really a boss, and 3 other bosses that I think make the DLC well and truly worth the price of admission. Some of these bosses may take hours to defeat, but once you learn their patterns, their attacks and the many ways to counteract them, it feels absolutely fantastic. 

Overall, this game for me is a 9/10"
This game is hard.  But it is fun until you get so irritated you stop playing it for a month.  lolol
"ez juego, no es pa tanto.


Gaa"
Third time i bought this game and i still love to run through it. an amazing finale to an amazing trilogy
Wish they transferred hours played from console to steam but anyway. This game makes me want to commit actions of violence against others and myself sometimes... highly recommend.
"Death is ahead, Just keep on praising the sun and you will make it ahead!"
"[b]Would[/b][strike]n't[/strike] [b]recommend it.[/b]
I've lost my saves somehow after I played 3 hours, but who cares you can run through everything in 30 minutes. :cleanseal:"
"Shadows die not once, but twice."
"Better than Dark Souls II
Worse than Dark Souls I
On par with Demon Souls.

Good game, but seemed easier."
Game is good and game is game :3
i suck but damn its a good game
Both the most frustrating and rewarding series ever to be created. 10/10
"I absolutely hate this game with every fibre in my being, compared to the other games in the souls series. This one stands out. From level progression making little sense in some places, to enemies that are clearly designed just to annoy you. Dare I even mention the archery spam in some parts of the map, making some areas which may appear cool into the most infuriating parts of the game.

Without a shadow of a doubt, this game is difficult. Not the standard souls experience. From targeting changes, to raw gameplay mechanics being changed. Do not go into this game expecting it to follow similar rules as previous and future titles.

However, with all that being said. Even with all the annoyances and hatred I have with this game. It is absolutely my favourite souls title in the series. It took me over 100 hours to realise this. Whilst there is no denying it's issues ( Lack of tracking on most weapons, targeting issues, hitboxes), it's strengths outshine it. It is different, it's a fresh experience from the others. The bosses each present a different challenge (sometimes it's the fact it's not a challenge). Interesting characters. Unique and intricate weapons to try out. Spells of varying effect. Dark souls 2 SOTFS Edition allows fun and interesting builds to go through the game. 

To summarise.
Coming from dark souls 1 to this was a culture shock, but it's easily my favourite due to its options. With the fact that I know I can never truly master this one like I have with the others. I love it, I hate it. I mostly hate it. But it is enjoyable at the very least."
"Ooh, a fork in the starter path. *dies* Nice boss! *dies^2*. So much death. Would recommend."
I like it but it also kinda sucks.
"I love this game franchise as a whole but I feel as though From Software made this one become one of the best in the Dark Souls series. I have yet to try multiplayer but the story and DLC were amazing! More lore to the story and my new favourite character, Dobv. If you love a good challenge that seriously says ""Fuck you, I hope you die 100 more times"" this is the game for you! Because the satisfaction you gain from it is amazing; Although that goes for an other Souls game.. P.S Dark Souls II = yucky"
come on... it's elden ring
Amzing gameplay and map layout. Has a really good story as well
"I had only started playing the Dark Souls series for the first time this year, and while I still liked the first one more, this one also was very enjoyable. 

I did like that the mechanics had only slightly changed, but in such a drastic way that it causes you to stumble a bit in the beginning if you had just only played the previous game as well.

This game is much much much longer than the first, but that's just fine if you wanted more dark souls anyways."
"VERY GOOD VERY GOOD VERY GOOD VERY GOOD

I'M SORRY"
"Tons of replayability, amazing gameplay, story telling is different but couldn't have been executed any better, adds a lot to the story of the franchise. PvP is the most popular due to how easy the mechanics became but at least you won't need  to wait for hours to find players to play against. The netcode is horrible as per the usual with the franchise."
"Loved the gameplay, wasn't too easy like other single player games. (though I don't like the system to play coop and how you have to restart if one of you die)"
Challenging to learn at first but after you get used to the parry mechanic it becomes a really fun experience. I highly recommend this game if youre looking for a difficult and fun game.
Fun but very hard love the boss fights and the puzzles keep is challanging stright up Great game
This game gave me PTSD. Would play again.
Best out of the 3 Darksouls games imo. All the bosses are good except Spear of the church and Cursed Rotted Greatwood. Most regular mobs can be tough but fair and the weapons are spectacular. I have beaten this game on normal mode 3 times now and I have a blast every time!
Easiest game of my life and it only took me 53 hours to beat it.
I am ginger and i approve of this game.
A similar but different game from souls series.
I went through worse than this
"don't be stupid unless it's funny, remember how you died, practice and patience

before long, the game will be over and you'll be ready to play it again and again and again and again...



by the way i own this game on console and tried to get it on pc for modding but it didn't run well so that's why i can write this and also it says it's refunded"
This game made me go to therapy.
"10/10. This game is a true masterpeice in my opinion, not even considering graphics or music here, the gameplay is the best i have ever experienced. The fighting is tough and at times, rageful, but fair, it is fluid, hard to master, but so satisfying if you do, this game's combat will truly put you in the gaming zone. its graphics are not the best, but still can do visuals incredibly in ceirtain areas, and there are some truly great and cinematic bossfights in this game. i say again, 10/10."
"I'll always love this game, no matter how many times i've died.
If you are new to the series, PLAY this, if you tried the previous games and didn't like it, PLAY this.

Great game."
Buy it if its on sale. Best DS entry fs
"Lots of new armors for me to look like a fashionable knight, or pretty princess when I strip hosts of their pale tongues.
I like it."
"Best game I have played so far,it has surpassed any other game that I have played in my life.It was fiest scary and where was tons of salt but I got gud."
"I felt i suck at this game, but i go back to the Dunkey video of this game and felt little better. This game test your patience to the very limit, but the moment i finally beat the boss, it felt like the burden was relieved. I tried my best not to break my controller after i raged quit. Instead i screamed ROBERRRRRRRRRT (from the dunkey video) 


just scream Robert/10"
Very hard to master. Reminds of  Souls in so many ways. But if you can get the technique down during boss fights you should be good to go. The graphics are 10/10. Very immersive.
"What can I say? It's Darksouls man, just play it."
"Too expensive for an 8 year old game, Pirate it."
"This is the hybrid Souls game in that it has some mechanics from Demon's Souls and Darks Souls 2 mixed in to Dark Souls 1 and it is great and should be purchased IMMEDIATLY!!!!!!


Be wary of message!"
"When you first start out you'll feel like everyone is running all over you. 
When you figure out the controls it'll feel like you're dancing through their blood. 
10/10"
TO HARD I LOVE IT or TO HARD TO LOVE IT ?
"Shitty game, too god damn hard.
Some shitty skeleton wheel faggots oneshoting me 
*Spits on game"""
"this game is very frustrating and i had to play it for 90+ hours before i was gud enough to finish it.

But barring a few difficulty spikes, it is also the funnest combat system i've played in years.

"
"Instead of running away like a frightened deer from bosses like you would in Dark Souls, in Sekiro will you need to confront them  directly. The parrying and posture mechanics actively reward you for having an aggressive playstyle, since enemies will recover their posture in an instant if you let them rest. You can also never run out of posture if you perfectly parry attacks, what a brilliant combat system.

Some stupid design choices have been made however, like ennemies that will still inflict damage even if you perfectly parry them (Blazing Bull, Demon of Hatred). Also some bosses require specific items in order to beat them, which is not only boring, but irritating. Fortunately most of these issues are optional, so experience them at your own risk.

The variety among bosses / mini-bosses is not impressive, with a lot of copy paste sub-bosses, but man those few fights are so memorable, so intense, with probably the best final boss in a video game, period.
This is mechanically the best From Software game, I obviously highly recommend getting this game right here and now!"
"Broke both my keyboard and my controller, lovely. 9.5/10"
My Favorite of the Souls/Borne Franchise. The Graphics are pretty Decent but the Fighting/Parry System is the best amongst every Soulslike Game imo. The World is Beautiful and Fun to explore. You can either sneak your way through the Story or simply mow everyone of them down. Furthermore you can fight them with many kinds of Skills and techniques to choose from. The Shinobi Prosthetic you get lets you vary the Weapon you want to fight with which adds a unique feature to this Game in the Series. Its a must try for every Hardcore Souls/Borne Fan and even without being a Fan its a Phenomenal Game on its own. 10/10 would recommend.
"I can finally play with friends ^~^

Worth. 

10/10 as a game
4/10 as a remastered"
"It has undead crazy people, medieval weaponry,talking cat, and death, lots of it.
10/10
Still haven't found Solaire though, he is in the game, ....right? right guys?

"
"It's no Dark Souls 1, but I would still highly recommend this to any hardcore gamer or who mildly liked Dark Souls or Demon's Souls.

I recommend using a controller (X360) and cannot comment on mouse and keyboard gameplay."
"Tis hard, cold but gentle place for a lonely flame to rest."
Fantastic game. Very unique compared to the other FromSoftware games.
"Could be good, needs a remaster."
Buy it. Just trust me and spend that 49.99.
"Wonderful artstyle, incredible environments and brilliant music, combined with the most refined combat system of the souls serie. Must have for all gamers looking for a challenge"
"other gamers gaslit me into thinking that this is a good game. do not let them lie to you, it is not a good game. massively overhyped, clunky, overly punishing, slow, and dull."
"Not mine - spent about 120 hours to came up to a conclusion
Difficulty is not to be skilled... its to go stupid farming to get your lvls to beat something. Ok, you can do quite everything without farming but the fights talke a lot of unnecessary time then.
The fighting feels so sluggy compared to other especially fighting games
Camera movement is a pain...
You can only reskill your charakter 5-times for ever play-through. And you have to free up the place to do it... just another time consumer.
Its a good idea to lvl up your weapons and armor but again you have to go stupid farming...

They tried to mix an Action Adventure with a Fighting Game. It's a good idea but lacks a lot of balancing (fighting, equip/stat ratio, bosses, etc.). And not maintained anymore today.

Pro:
Level, Sound and Character Design is neat and was the main reason to keep playing. Over this they did a good job by scripting quite every corner and you get scared/thrilled very often. But playing through 1 time is enough for me.

All in all everything in this game feels like unnecessary time wating. I know some people like exactly this but for me it's not up to date. Maybe Sekiro would be better for me. After all these years the best Soulslike for me was ""Severance: Blade of Darkness"" so far.

Even after 5 years it's fair to do such a comment if they still wanna take the full/high price for it. Really FromSoftware if you want that high price after all the years go on and maintain your stuff. And over all implement an anticheat like othes said.

I can not recommand it especial for that high price tag for the reasons aboce. Also if your a casual gamer wanna just play throug a game you probably get frustrated cause the difficulty might be hard for you."
"this game has changed me, it showed me things i never thought id be interested in like sword fighting and super epic music. very nice game"
"Medieval Rolling Sport Simulator 2016

[strike] It's a shame that the online mode is dead for god knows how long, and to complete it, you need to rely on RNG drops that take hours. But[/strike] it's a great game for the exploration, enemies and gameplay. Although, do expect a lot of rolling. From yourself and others.

Oh, and it's hard. Duh."
"Hand it over. That thing, your wallet."
never ending agony and i am just in the forest of giants i have not seen the rest
"This is my favorite game.  I played the original DS, and find this one to be a little easier due to the higher frequency of bonfires. The graphics are good, gameplay is smooth and addictive, and you can play this for only an hour or two a night while slowly leveling up your character.  I recommend creating several different characters, and go back and forth between each saved profile.  The game is more fun the more times you tackle a familiar setting.  4 1/2 stars out of 5.  If you like this game, also check out Bloodborne by the same developer."
"Solid Game. If you don't know what this is, you should research first."
"Scholar of the First Sin uses what was in Dark Souls 2 better. Enemy placements are better and expanded, items in places that make more sense, and more of that Dark Souls hair tearing out experience.

The DLCs are simply fabulous and very well done. Truly worth playing through if only to get the weapons in the DLCs that have the coolest movesets."
Holy shit great game. Much better than vanilla DS2 and is entertaining for a long time compared to what it costs.
When is DLC or Sekiro 2 coming out pls.
Dark souls fans when they can't roll their way out of mortgage
"This game may have its faults, and be rather clunky at times yes. But with all that into account I can say that i rather like this game. It has more content than the other games in the series. Although feeling unfinished at times, and being overloaded with mobs to fight. Seriously though, new game adds more stuff to straight up gank you. But I still like this game, the characters you get to talk to and the areas you get to explore is what makes me like this game so much. You need to look at this game with a open mind to enjoy it. So many armor combinations, weapons and spells you can use to craft your character to what you want it to be. Loads of hidden things that are waiting for you to find them. (Unless you watch a let's play or something then I guess you know where these things are XD). And playing both dark souls 1, and 3, not bloodborne since I don't own a ps4. I can say this game holds up to still being a great game, despite having to hold up to expectations that the games before and after it made. (I'm probably rambling at this point so yeah lmao). The gist of what I'm trying to say is, if you come into this game not comparing it to the other games. And talk to the NPC's around the world, explore and do things without looking them up then this game will be a amazing experience for you."
"Probably my favorite dark souls - unfortunately, the game is dead and a lot of my most liked aspects and mechanics are worthless and pointless"
Give in to your Dark Soul.
Clap your flint cheeks so hard you bring about the age of fire.
"Dark souls 3 is by far the best instalment in the series , gameplay wise, lore wise , multiplayer wise.
except poise thats broken. 
"
"I finally finished Sekiro after 38 hours of pure Agony of my soul. Right after I did, I realized I... want to play it again. If it isn't madness yet, the game must be worth any penny."
amazing game praise the sun and allah
"It's not just a bad souls game. It's a bad game in general. The DLCs do not make up for the bad quality. The snow DLC is one of the worst areas in the series. Ugly textures, repetitive and boring mobs."
"kicks you in the balls until you have no balls, therefore no pain and can continue through like nothing matters anymore and finally kill everyone

very good"
"El juego tiene puntos excelentes, la ambientación es espectacular y hay peleas contra boses inolvidables que me han encantado, las peleas contra Sir Alone y El caballero del Humo son GOD, Majula es un escenario espectacular cuando lo ves por primera vez, en general el juego es increíble y me ha gustado en casi todos los aspecto pero por desgracia no voy a poder matar a todos los jefes como quería, y por desgracia nunca lo haré una lástima pero este juego tiene un error de diseño horrible en una parte específica. Estaba disfrutando mucho el juego, me parecía espectacular y muy bien logrado, hasta hasta que decidí pegarle al rey  Vendrik y resulta que no le hacía nada de daño, lo intenté matar muchas veces pero nada. Resulta que necesitas almas de gigante para matarlo y esas almas son consumibles, es decir, te dan la opción de consumir las almas y sin ellas la batalla contra Vendrik se convierte en una pelea extremadamente desagradable y estúpida, calculando voy a tener que estar peleando 30 o 40 minutos contra él. Por qué un objeto tan importante para matar a un jefe resulta ser un consumbile? que sentido tiene eso? acaso no puedo hacer uso de los recursos que tengo en el juego por la posibilidad de que sean un objeto clave?, quien fue el retrasado mental que tuvo esta idea?. En fin este juego es una maravilla, no le voy a quitar mérito por esta estupidez, maté a todos los jefes de los dlc exploré todas las zonas que pude y me la pasé increíble. Pero esto que hicieron al final es completamente imperdonable, me quitó por completo las ganas de seguir intentándolo, ahora en Dark Souls 3 no voy a querer consumir nada porque tal vez y solo tal vez sea un item necesario para algo, en fin un diseño horrible que arruinó mi experiencia al final del juego, por suerte el juego puede pasarse sin matar a ese boss pero aún así me molestó mucho el diseño que tiene y lo peor es que te pierdes dos boses porque no podrás matar a Eldia :("
"Got exactly what I was hoping for. Dark Souls with a better framerate and graphics. I do not understand why people are so upset about this. This is what they promised, this is what they delivered."
i love it elden ring is overwhelming
"A great game, i really enjoyed it. Made me feel like a badass ninja."
"Start world, get killed.
Fight undead, get killed.
Praise the sun, get killed.
Get killed, get killed.

10 /10 souls I lost when i was killed."
"A masterpiece. Evocative atmosphere, great fighting, cool level design. Better than the first and the second in all ways."
Great souls-like game and requires a lot of skill
"Dark Souls 3 is an amazing game,

the beginning seems a little tough specifically for newer players but once you get through Vordt of the Boreal valley it seems to even itself out nicely. 

this game has less filler than the previous titles and the movement and animations are more fluid which is always a nice improvement. 

also being able to teleport around right from the start is a nice feature though im sure some people would rather have it the classic way of walking around and backtracking 24/7.

The last boss provides a good challenge that doesn't feel unfair it seems to gather all the skills you've gotten from playing the game and put it in the fight which goes to show how well the Devs put this game together.

overall amazing game and would recommend to anyone looking for an amazing and challenging experience.

9.8/10"
Hard and rewarding. Beautiful atmosphere and world.
"Its a pretty solid game, will test your perfect parry skills for sure but at the end of the day i think it is pretty overrated. Elden ring for me was a much better game. A lot of sekiro's boss fight are kinda boring and not impressive. All and all good game but  not as good as what everyone says. OFC that is my opinion."
"Possibly the hardest game i have ever played, but sooooo rewarding. SO memorable. I loved this, I didn't want it  to end."
"Hard game, this is.

Frustratingly enjoyable, it was.

Approve, I do."
Dark Souls is like a Toxic girlfriend with whom you are madly in love with. You cant do without her...
"Glad to be back at it!! the 50% off worth every penny!

Dont Be Mad Git Gud 

10/10 To the Die Hards"
"If you want a game that is visually stunning, sounds amazing and loves beating you to a pulp because it hates you.  This is the game for you.
 
This one of the few games that makes you work to finish it, and provides great sense of satisfaction each time you defeat one the game’s numerous and varied bosses.

Jolly Co Operation is great, but the laggy invaders are frustrating to say the least."
Quite possibly my favorite series of all time.
"Dark Souls 3 III is a super game it was so fun playing. i've never really played a RPG before so it was pretty new for but that just made it even more fun. i think it's great that you have to learn the patterns of the bosses and that made beating them even more satisfying. 
I was very intrigued by the story but still don't really get it. in a way that just makes it more intriguing."
"Great game ! Really fun if played with friends, easier multiplayer set up unlike DS1 but still a really fantastic game to play. Easier then the first in my opinion but still a bit of a challenge can't wait for the DLC to come out."
Fantastic game over all in terms of pvp its the best game in all soulsborne series
"Puntos positivos: Una experiencia maravillosa que no querrás dejar una vez que te adaptes a ella.
Puntos negativos: Pésimos controles para teclado y ratón. un online que no funciona desde hace meses y capado a 60 FPS."
"it isa very contrersal remaster but i think that the good out way the bad in the new changes and i am really enjoying it so far and that if you like the franchise i would definatly recomended it but i would play 3 first becase it is more challenging and i think it is a bit more fun as well and fair and dosent lag as much as blight town but i think overall i would give it a 7 out of 10 so far
(do not play 2 its abslout trashg and we pretend it dosent exsist becase its fucking terible)"
I played it for a bit. The graphics are nice and the scenery is beautiful to look at if nothing is trying to kill you. The combat is fluid and punishing. Dark souls 3 is a better tie in to the Souls series than Dark souls 2.
Everything but PvP deserves a thumbs-up.
"I in fact, did die twice."
I did not find my own sun I only found pain
"In my opinion the BEST game from all the Dark Souls Franchise. Even if you didin't play in previous one, you must play in this one. I dont have to recommend it to Dark Souls fans... Why are you still reading this ? BUY IT!!!!"
"A lot of people may be spooked by dark souls 3, and may just not play it because of that reason. I haven't beaten the game, but I have beaten the abyss watchers and my experience to that point has been a great one. Exploring amazing maps gives me a great feeling and beating a boss makes me feel proud of myself. I definetly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG games or just sword fighting games. It may be difficult, but I think that its difficulty gives it a good feel to it."
"Dark Souls 2 SOTFS is special because I've never loved a game this much while simultaneously hating every bit of it. It's all the things I love about Dark Souls but weird and floaty and with large hitboxes and with no i-frames. The thing that really gets me is just how much there is to do compared to the original, and how much more visually interesting literally the entire map is. It might have some weird combat quirks, but SOTFS is still a really great game. Except for fall damage. Like whats up with that.

10/10 Would get deleted by Lost Sinner again"
gave the game another chance and boy i was wrong the first time
"Best game in my life. And for PC players, bonus boss fight: run a game itself without issues, which make it unplayable. Use PC exclusive skills, like ""tweaking drivers"", ""use all possible graphic settings combinations"", ""reinstall os"" and, of course ""try to run it on friend's PC"".
One true heir of the DS1 (remember DSfix?).
Also, there is some insignificant things, like astonishing design and atmosphere, little but convinient improvements in gameplay mechanics and some more."
"I loved how, even without a stamina bar to worry about, a FromSoftware game still managed to break my spirit and my keyboard"
I like it. I cant say this for everyone but it has replay value. You can create different builds and tweak it to suit your needs. If it seems like something you would be into try it.
"It's sad that this is going to be the last souls game I'll ever play (unless they make another but who knows). The game was very fun and a great conclusion to whichever endings you picked. Honestly, Thank You From Software."
Probably the best game ever made IMO. This is an absolute masterpiece and a blast to play co-op with your friends in. The level design is excellent and the boss fights always keep you on your toes. This game is flawless.
"Very easy game, not for the simple casul player. less than 15% of player actually beat the first boss, yikes man"
this has truly been the dark souls of telling your fans servers will be fixed by elden ring's release then doing nothing and going radio silent for the next 2 months
"Gawd, do not touch this pile of excrement if you are using keyboard + mouse. Waste your money on something that is not broken!
Even if you own a controller, I would still urge you not to touch this due to a multitude of other problems, already mentioned in almost every other negative review."
"Game runs like absolute cr*p no matter the settings, runing it on low on a RX 570 I still get frame drops. Also the online is absolute garbage, the game's unbalanced, the anti-cheat is ineffective and it lacks a ping filter."
"2 spooky 4 me 
did not even play 30 minif you wanna rage its the tilte 4 you"
"This game is fun, stressful, artsy, compelling, unique, and its hard not to be passionate about it, be that anger or joy..."
OST is amazing plus the gameplay is fantastic.
nobody gonna talk about how thicc asylum demon is?
Just play a dex build. You'll be fine.
meh game no so good i think
"No wonder why this game is game of the year. Recommended for all dark soul lovers and Elden ring players.
Worth It !!"
"Sekiero > going to Class. 
You'll be unemployed anyway so you might as well play this master piece."
"Incredible game but pretty challenging even compared to Dark Souls. That being said, this is a great game, great atmosphere, story, music, voice acting, character development. If you can mitigate the difficulty and learning curve, this is one of the greatest game ever made."
"Pros:
[list]
[*] Great story telling where everything is kinda abstractive
[*] Great soundtracks
[*] Boss fight are really challenging
[*] Very good Art , Graphics are really good
[*] You can play with friends even with different levels (game nerf your stats) 
[/list]
cons:
[list]
[*] Lots of problems in pvp (not balance for many weapons or magics)
[*] Locked in 60fps
[*] Console controller Icons only!!!
[*] Invaders can invade you with best weapons of game and full estus at sl 10!!!
[*] BUGS! (for example if a fps bug happens during trading with pickle pee , game kicks you out for a restart and you can't take your item until ng+)
[*] lots of hacker as always , in my 275 hrs of gameplay i saw 30 hackers at least (maybe i'm unlucky)

"Fromsoftware games have their own particular quality. I enjoy it as it helps me practice parrying and dodging as I usually slug my way in most combat games. Like their other works, I have slowly delved into and really like the major and minor characteristics in these games; Major, being the game mechanics that are sewn through out each series and the unique attack patterns bosses and certain enemies lay out, to Minor, being the story, the music, and detail that sets a tone for each game and atmosphere, that separates them from being 'copies', of one another. Great and challenging, and so immersive as always."
"I wrote an email requesting a rename to ""Super realistic death simulator 2014"""
"Death Filled Fun!

+ Graphics:  Models and textures are top notch (not perfect) and the areas are jam packed with props (unlike DS2)
+ Areas: The areas are much more detailed and they seem to be more Gothic than DS2 which is great!
+ Gameplay: Faster and more fluid combat makes the game harder and more enjoyable
+ Animations: Combat ""moves"" are based on the weapon you wield, more so than DS2, very fun!
+ Enemies: Much more enjoyable foes, and tons of diversity in each type, lots of ""Mini-bosses"" throughout the game
+ Story: Like all Souls games the story line is subtle but potent, I love the dark/gothic feel
+ Weapons/ Armor: Tons of variations of each weapon (melee, ranged, and magic)

- Optimization: The game is hard to run (FX-8350 / R9 290 = ~50 FPS on 1440p - High Settings - No AA)
- Optimization: The game has alot of FPS spikes, FPS will drop from 50 to 20 for a second than back to 50
- Difficulty: The game is difficult but in alot of ways less harsh; No hollowing, you start with 3 estus flask, items seem to break way slower than DS2, souls seem easier to aquire, can sell items very early in the game, more bonfires, and the limited use items seem to be more plentyful and cheaper to buy

OVERALL: 9/10 The game is enjoyable and difficult and once a few patches roll out the optimization will improve, buy it, play it, embace death, and do not forget to PRAISE THE SUN!"
This game is in my top 10
fun to kill the big guys
"Fromsoft have deactivated the servers for Dark Souls series so it's no longer possible to play online. Meaning no PVP, No coop, no blood, no signs... Half the game, just gone..."
"You fight a tough enemy, shoot 50 bolts on him, f. e. a dragon, and before he dies you get summond to a covenant fight. You return, the boss has full health again, and you ve not enough bolts left to kill him. SHIT FUCK SUCKS. 

Enemies can hit you with Halberd through TWO WALLS... 
Enemies can even spread fire through thick walls. WTF. 

You use ""intensive sweat"" against fire damage, but enemy can instant kill you with a single fire blow. - even with sweat, full health bar and medium high level. Just ridiculous.

Enemies can even hit you with a 10 m chain through walls, columns n all survaces. 
There´s a difference between DIFFICULT and UNFAIR / IDIOTIC."
kinda shit but i might just be bad
Died uncountable times and loved every time
"Even though it is in early access, the current content is super fun and has quite a bit of replay-ability
"
"An absolute disappointment to the entire From Soft library. It doesn't live up at all to the other soulsborne games for multiple reasons. 1) A heavy reliance on ganks and ambushes. Whoever directed this game thought it would be a good decision to place a thousand random enemies with super aggro ranges that doesn't even make sense. You could peek from a wall and all the enemies would just magically spot you in pure darkness. 2) Changes to healing. They butchered the estus flask with laughably slow recovery and numerous other items that do it better. Lifegems, for example, recovery health at a much slower rate than estus and are found/bought throughout the game, but you can hold an infinite amount of them and stack  the healing effect while in combat so that you don't have to worry about standing still while you chug away on the flask. Other items include divine blessings, better variants of the gems, monastery charms, dragon charms, crimson and rouge water, and Elizabeth mushrooms. 3) The agility stat. This stat governs the speed at which you use consumables, i.e. estus flasks, and the I-frames you get while dodging. The problem with this is you have to invest points into this stat if you want to be more successful on your dodge timing, which shouldn't be because dodge rolling is a mechanical skill that you have to learn, and agility makes it very difficult for new players to understand this. 4) The PC port is doodoo balls. If you're playing with M+KB like me, you'll probably be messing with the key bindings for a solid 30 minutes. I had to remap more than half of the default bindings in order to make it feel more playable. Also if you're using a mouse to attack, be sure to disable the double-click for strong attack as it causes bad input lag. I spent a good amount of time playing with the lag and it was dreadful to fight enemies. 5) The bosses are boring/easy (The Crown of the Old Iron King DLC is an exception).  Nothing much to say, the bosses were just not that enjoyable. I can count on one hand how many bosses I genuinely enjoyed fighting.

In short, horse but hole."
"Bleak grimdark fantasy with an unparalleled sense of progression, exploration and accomplishment. It took me many aborted playthroughs over many years before something finally clicked and I couldn't put it down. Truly one of the best action RPGs ever made with some of the most satisfying combat you can experience in a video game. The remastered version is a solid port that has maintained a surprisingly high player base and is well worth your money and time."
This is what Nioh tried so hard to be
"fire and dung, what's not to like"
"Tough, but fair... for the most part. Graphics are great. Controls for mouse and keyboard are a little cumbersome, but on any controller is much smoother handling. Sound is solid, being mostly sword clashes and death sounds. Score of the game is a musical masterpiece, fighting bosses is made into an epic by the presence of it. Replay factor is good for at least 2 playthroughs as that is the necessary amount for all achievements, after that it remains, though not as strong."
"TLDR: It's a Souls game, so it's good. This game's the wonkiest of the lot and has some pretty shit design in places but it's hard to fuck up a Souls game.

Dark Souls 3 is the weakest in the Souls series in my opinion. It's very linear, has some very obnoxiously designed enviroments and what would have been cool bosses are somewhat ruined by putting needless gimmicks into their fights. The online play component makes it easier to find friends to play with but at the same time has some more notably poor design and a lack of game balance when it comes to invasions, a core component of Dark Souls PvP.
That said, it's STILL Dark Souls. The non-gimmick bosses are amazing, the game looks fantastic, the NPCs (especially Siegward) are colourful, combat is tough but rewarding (though this game really upped the ante on bullshit deaths and wonky hitboxes) and as always the music is fantastic."
So good man what a great game i love this game i dont want to die i promise
I've had medical procedures more fun than this.
"Great game, beautiful visuals, ruthless difficulty and borrows some of the game mechanics from every other Souls game. If only i could be so grossly incandescent as my character."
"This game is incredible, The deflect system feels so good to use, The boss design is fantastic with the bosses each teaching you something and testing the players skill. 

I am not an enormous Souls like fan myself I beat Fallen Order but didn't enjoy Dark Souls series. Having said that the difficulty this game provides was enough to keep me enthralled. The drive to get better and be stronger, to tighten up reflexes and improve the reliability of your reads feels so good. When you beat the final boss after possibly an hour of trying and I felt all those sorts of things click you know what this game taught you and that you overcame it. 

Buy it."
"TL;DR 

Dark souls 2 SoTFS is game with great potential and huge item pool and interestinf story but is less refined and filled with cheap deaths compared to other soulslike games but can still be fun. If you are fan of the series and want to explore new and challenging worlds, go for it. If you are new to soulsborne games, take DS3 or DS1 Remastered. 

Pros:
+Huge, interesting and beatiful world to explore.

+Biggest item pool out of all soulslike games

+Interesting mechanics like pharros lockstones and bonfire aesthetics

+Huge pool of bosses an enemies

Cons:
-Filled with cheap tactics like constant drops which is coupled with wonky controls which is not 360 degrees like other games but 8 point system, you can go from a bit leaning to side to 90 degree angle and drop from one of MANY death drops. in almost every zone there is death drop.

-Enemy spam and in late game they become also damage sponges which hit you like a truck late game, and game loves to spam them like there is no tomorrow constantly. Couple that with fact that they can stunlock you easly and many have no wind-up to attacks and unlimited stamina is really cheap. Even starting enemies like hollow soldiers, if there is more than 3 of them can take half your health even at higher levels, i mean 80+ with good armor and kill you instantly at lower levels.

-Armor seems non-existent. This feels wierd because it kinda works but don't. At start you can feel the effects of armor somewhat but late game it is better to be able to roll faster, have better stamina regen than good defense. 

-AGI stat. It seems they wanted to make stat like Resistance from DS1 work and they did, but in a bad way. Agi stat increases your iframes to up to .53 seconds if you invest, BUT it also affects your estus drinking speed and spell casting speed. This makes lower level players to suffer so much. You take damage from every roll which was not pixel perfect but in late game you roll trough everything. And couple the fact that you drink estus leasurely at lover agi levels, and with second con point. You will die. 

-Lifegems. No need for estus just pop this gem which you can stack to 99 and go for it. Also you get unlimited supply of it very early in game.
-Frigid Outskirts. Combines everything that is bad and cheap about this game. Even at SL250+ at NG you will struggle. 

-Secret doors made bad. there are many secret doors which there are but there is no indication of them. You just need to run by all walls and spam use if you want to find them. 

-Fragrant branch of yore mechanics.

-Falconeer knight running animation."
"Dark Souls is the Dark Souls of the Dark Souls series - 10/10, would die again"
"Honestly Ive Played this game a good amount and im not even sure of my progress. Honestly if you want to get the Full Enjoyment of this game Avoid Guides and Glitches, If you avoid those things This game will cause you the most Pain and Anger you'll Ever Feel. Its Difficult More Difficult then i thought, Besides all the Anger This game has caused me its great if you want Challenge. Like all the Fellow Souls Game Players We are Just Waiting For Elden Ring So Until Then Ill be playing Dark Souls 1-3 And Demon Souls Which I have On PS5 Great Remaster btw if you have a PS5 and Haven't Played that Check it out"
fantastic game for people who get enjoyment from failing
"Pretty damn good, but I died more than twice tho..."
No matter how many times you play this game. You're always going to come back
Endless punishment for a long tunnel with a flickering light at the end.
I cant get past the tutorial
beat dark souls and you can thrive in life..or just play more dark souls
I want the Emerald Herald to step on me
"A great game that encourages you to use all the tools at your disposal to beat everyone you come across. I enjoyed getting 100% and only wish there was more for me, the combat feels really responsive and fast paced. Recommend it fully. If there is only one thing I have to say against it. it would be certain grab hitboxes, but that is about it."
"Personally this is the best in the series for me. It's lore, plot are deep, interconnected and extremely interesting. However, the game has two serious problems. 1st one is the number of enemies. Yes while in most cases if you are careful or tactical(basically, use the bow) you can avoid getting ganked, you will still get ganked- there just is no running away from that cheapness. Some areas will make you want to go berserk and start killing real people left and right just get the frustration and rage out of your veins. Second is the soul memory which basically makes multiplayer a lot more scarce than a normal souls game can already be. go overboard on gaining souls early on and later you won't get help/ won't be able TO HELP/ will have to stay at bonfires for hour after putting up signs just to get summoned(you still might just not get anyone), gain souls too less and same thing happens. But if you can look ahead then you will get a game that's just as good as the other two in the series if not better than both. The story is solid, characters have their own stories, bosses have their own lores that might reach right up to DS1's lores, the feeling of looking at the castles and areas of so many civilizations past will make you ponder- just what happened here?
I definitely recommend the game to people, who like setting themselves on fire- just to feel alive."
This game may be trash but its my trash
"Good, but easier than I expected. Playing this directly after Blood Borne may leave you wanting for a greater challenge."

If there was a video game equivalent to dropping the soap this would be that game.
Game good I like being a ninja and killing all the toys eheheheheheheheh
"incredibly difficult at first, although after a lil while stuff just starts to make sense"
15/10 Game needs to be played by everyone
Probably one of the best single player games ive played until now.
"I had to restart one time after realizing there is an incorrect way to level things up, but had a blast with the challenges!"
"I am only rating this game as negative because when i load it up its incredibly zoomed in and my mouse icon will keep flashing as if its being tabbed in and out of! I have tried everything and it doesnt work. All resolution fixes failed, and even tweaked the launch settings and still nothing! Does anyone know how to resolve this? I really would like to play this game... lol"
"First game to play on controller via PC as it seems optimised for it. I was looking for a game to kick back on the couch and play whilst combating the 'rona. This game will have you edging right up to the screen not only because of how detailed and amazing the world is but mainly to yell profanities at the reasons why your just not cut out for the pressure. 

This game is a pressure cooker for gamers and if you think you can turn to someone else to help you through then think again. Out of the boss fights only a couple are coop-able and most of the time you end up just fighting a harder boss because the other guy folds. But you cant be mad because they fold under the intense perfection this game demands - one move your out. It will have you drumming over loadouts and whether its viable or not to 'farm' souls to level a certain way. Farming is not really farming in DS3. You can be suddenly overwhelmed by even the simplest of foes who reveal a well-disguised attack combination coupled with the herniating impatience you have for having to pace out each encounter like its your last. Its better to continue on and fight the harder foes who reward accordingly. 

I was mainly a strength build (Quality Build) so I cannot say much for hack'n'slash satisfaction points but hard hitting weapons seemed to be the best route for myself - limiting how much parrying and jostling around I'll have to do before they actually fall. This came down to patience again. I became my own worst enemy with wanting faster encounters that I could blitz through as opposed to grinding away at a shield+sword to play it safe. 

Patience is tied into every facet of this game from its detail, mechanics, design and lore to what is expected as a player entering the Dark Souls world. This lead to a hugely rewarding experience as your patience pays off when you take the time to learn how to master the weaponry and loadout you have chosen in every situation the game deals out IE dying 50+ times against a single Black Knight just to learn and feel comfortable fighting them in scenarios later in the game which ended up paying off as you fight these targets regularly. 

10/10 well developed, edge-of-your-seat type stuff, teaches a lot of patience and badassery whilst showing zero mercy.

I usually cant stand controller but this worked out really well."
I'm tired of crying. I just wanna win
"One of the best games i've played ever, completed NG today unlocking one of the three endings and there is still plenty left for me to do. The boss fights were both challenging and rewarding, The PVP was intense, and the lore was great. It combines all the best elements of the Soulsborne games into one super game essentially. There are glitches and bugs here and there which I hope FROMSOFT fixes like the no animation summons/invaders as well as lack of summons for Sentinel/Darkmoon covenant members, but other than that, I enjoyed the game a lot and will continue playing for a long time :D! 

Thanks FROMSOFT!!!


9/10 (10/10 with ember)"
Highly recommend people to grab this game man there is a reason it won game of the year.
"Damn dodging in this game wouldn't suffice, well you can always reassign the dodge button to parry :P Hacks"
This game made me feel something I haven't felt in a long time
"This game is diffcult but fun to play,powerful enermies for u to defeat.u cant get bored playing this game worth for buying"
"If I can beat it, so can you. 10/10 combat."
I've played this game for 12 hours and I already wanna die 10/10

"This game was beautiful. Best combat system ever. Though, that ogre in the beginning gave me PTSD."
It has so much charm and is a lot of fun but holy hell does this makes me want to tear my hair out. Super worth trying out.
"I bought this game yesterday and have been playing it non-stop with my boyfriend. For context, I do not like rogue-lite/dungeon crawlers. If they are too difficult or too easy, I will not play it. I much prefer farming games like Stardew or open world games like Valheim and Grounded. This has found the perfect balance between ramping difficulty between worlds and ramping power of your character. It is incredibly fun with incredibly whimsical and clever character designs. Each character really stands out, even the mobs. I can really tell that a lot of care has been put into each aspect of the game. Even each skill feels very unique and fun (summoning spirits is my favorite). I love finding new synergies between skills and relics. Although there isn't much content out yet, and I've already gone the 4 worlds, I feel like this game has a lot of replay-ability. I can't wait to run it back with different strategies. I will be coming back for more when new content is released. Highly recommend 11/10!"
"New to Dark Souls franchise, heard all the tales of loss and grief...none of it was a lie, have nearly broken so many things but regardless the game is a run RPG that feels so rewarding when you see that next bonfire."
"Probably the most fun combat in any game I've played. This isn't dark souls; you can't spam the dodge button and win. You have to parry most everything that comes at you. The game very much forces souls veterans to adapt to the new combat style. Once you become accustomed however, the game becomes much easier and even more fun."
good game just it didnt let me transfer my ps4 data fuck u
"Probably the best Dark Souls game, and also one of the most difficult.  If you like swinging big swords and feeling the satisfaction of beating something that kicked your ass for an hour, this is the game for you.  Highly recommend reading a leveling guide if you aren'f familiar with Souls games because you can pretty easily gimp yourself."
I f***ing hate this game. 10/10

"Will kick you in the balls over and over, and you'll hate yourself. But some how I love this game... Well I guess I'm a masochist now..."
"[h1]Taxing but Fair // Recommended for the challenge[/h1]

+ Leveling up system allows for nearly endless customization
+ Fast travel is a welcome addition
+ Extremely, endlessly challenging
+ Max health is decreased on a player's death, further increasing the challenge & difficulty
+ Incredible environment designs; does well to encourage & reward fervent exploration
+ Multiplayer elements & PVP are just as well-done as the previous game, if not better
+ Detailed & inventive visual designs for both enemies & the player's armor/clothing/weapons
+ Covenant system adds much to the experience

- Learning curve can be immensely frustrating
- Textures have aged a bit, but it's not unbearable by any means

"Dark Souls, Looks Slightly Better Edition"
"I have some of the best memories from this game. I played it daily when it released and for years after the addiction just progressively got worse. The only thing that stopped me was the release of Elden Ring and I still have urges to play DS3. The player base was moderately active for a good amount of time as well. There are some great mods for this game, too if you're like me and have sunken in over 1,000 hours.

Save yourself from hackers and download Blue Sentinel mod from Nexus, trust me."

"Amaazing Game, Probably one of the best games out there other than DS1 remastered"
"This game is awsome at most times this is not about going foward and not dieing you will die in this game a lot so if you have anger issues i would not suggest this game to the anger issue people but try it, itr's worth the 50 bucks thats fore sure it's also more smoother than the first one also the most graphiced game i seen like in 2011 i seen this game is awsome till i saw this i bought it and i remember the hate times and good times i had in this game well have fun in this game."
"Game wont load up after the intro movie :/
its just an infinite loading screen, if yall could help me out on it, itd be much appreciated.
If not well, I guess Ill just bench the game until i can find a fix :/"
Exciting and thrilling! a true RPG genre with a hard combat gameplay and very worth rewarding system.

You're just endlessly learning impossible bosses. A lot of your success will be based on the frequency in which your opponents use their most broken abilities. It's exhausting and ultimately unfun.
Its tough but not that tough. Youll get through it if your paitent
"Don't let the mixed review put you off, this game is by and large one of the best gaming experiences I've had to date. Though it's unfortunate that we can't purchase the old edition anymore on Steam, this is well worth the price on sale, and I recommend it to anybody who's even remotely interested."
Great game would definitely play with my self at night when i cannot sleep and im in bed thinking about anime girls and what the legal age in japan is
"This is the BEST game, i had sheit ton of fun playing it"
"I will always have a soft spot for the first souls game but Dark Souls 3 is simply the best in the series. graphics are great, gameplay is fluid and fun, weapon arts and new mechanics add some very welcome depth, and overall this game is just the best. Besides, since hollowing is optional then I can always go for full fashion souls."
"I am Malenia, Blade of Miquella"
"Despite it being a disappointing remaster that adds very little, it's still worth getting over the original port. I managed to get a similar look to the original by using reshade and you don't clip through the floor if you slide down a ladder at 60fps. 

Though I will say they should at least include the original if you buy this game."

"Context: I've seen all endings, went Charmless on my first NG+ and used exclusively Sword and Mortal Draw, except for 'Shura' Ending, where I was basically forced to use the Umbrella for the second phase of the last boss.

The game is amazing. The exploration is fast paced and the combat is brutal as expect from a Souls-like, but it's has a rhythm to it. You put on the pressure, parry the counter attacks and keep the pressure up to deal with bosses, making it extremely satisfying when you pull a good fight off even if you already beaten the boss a number of times before.

Coming from someone who loved Dark Souls and Bloodborne, this game was the most fun I've had with a FromSoftware game. It's the only one I've beaten more than once and can confidently say I own every boss.

Overall it's an almost perfect game for what it proposes to do, can't recommend it enough."
"Ive played all dark souls games and beaten all of them and this just like the others is better in some categories and worse in some to the other games and this might be my favorite one of the 3
"
"I had a rough time playing this game the first time (Prepare to Die edition).  But, it took a second approach for me to truly enjoy this.  This game isn't actually all that hard.  Oh sure, it's challenging, but it's far from the hardest game I ever played... I'd argue Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link was way harder.

What I love most about this game is how there appear to be multiple solutions to the same problem.  You can brute force it with enough time, but other times there are just smarter ways about doing things.  The game really doesn't expect you to spend 5 hours against a boss with no mistakes - if that's happening to you, then you're missing something.

I will say, though, you're better off playing this game in offline mode.  It's not that I don't like the challenge of fighting other players, but unfortunately the metric by which other players get matched with me is kinda skewed wrong, players themselves can fool with the system to be higher level than the game wants to believe... But while I can deal with the occasional invasion, what I cannot deal with were the hackers.  Hacking is to be expected in every game, and I expected there to be players with teleportation, god mode, and 1-hit kills... What I did not expect is for players to be able to warp in, afflict you with curses and egg-disease, kill you, then modify your character so that you're aligned with a covenant you shouldn't be part of yet in an effort to get you banned should you ever join up with a friend due to the game detecting you cheating.  Your only choice is to delete your character and start over from scratch.  

So like I said - unless you want to deal with randos popping in and giving your character digital AIDS, just play it in offline mode."
hate it when 6 guys gang up on me and turn me in sliced bread but other than that great game 10/10 highly recommend it
allows you to truly enjoy dieing a lot
"Amazingly crafted, well done however PLEASE fix the engine, micro stutters when the map is loading in is super annoying and sometimes it happens randomly but other than that definitely worth playing."
"It was difficult at times, but I really enjoyed this game nonetheless! It was also worth getting all the achievements, albeit a few were a bit grindy to get.

Can't wait to hear more about Elden Ring!"
Beautiful game. Its only hard if you like your games to be played for you.
"Muito bom, apanhei igual um condenado, porém como diz no vídeo do gemaplys (o motivo de eu comprar esse game) com o tempo você aprende que é um jogo pra mostrar até aonde sua força de vontade vai, porque meu amigo que força de vontade você precisa, porém é um jogo que faz você sentir a vitoria, não é igual outros jogos que você só mata um bixinho ali e cabo, aqui você vai lembrar dos npcs, até porque se você não lembrar uma hora ou outra eles vão aparecer nas tuas costas te enfiar a porrada e fazer você sair correndo pro colinho da mamãe, porém eu acho um jogo incrível que vale a pena ser jogado."
shit game when is demon souls coming to pc
"Everyone is absolutely correct, but my biggest props have to go to the boss designs, and the overall aesthetic. Every boss has definition with every aspect. They way they move, their moveset, their theme's and atmosphere. Take for example, (spoilers) the Dancer fight. On your first/second playthrough, every movement both you and the boss make is like... well a dance of sorts. Abyss Watchers (more spoilers) shows that they are doomed to fight each other for eternity after going hollow. Hell, you could even watch them fight each-other till second phase. Point is, the design behind this game (if you exclude Lothric Knight Straight Sword) is absolutely fantastic, and easily puts this game in my Top 10 list. 

We all know that Knack 2 is game of the year, every year."
Best feeling Souls game like bloodborne and the bosses are very good with amazing OSTs  and DLC is worth a standalone game for that matter one of my favs.
"Game has never crashed, best souls to date. Gundyr is a good noob filter."
"I'm giving Dark Souls II a negative review, not because it is a bad game, but because it is a bad souls game. Everything feels clunky, you are forced to grind towards the start to get healing items, and the combat feels unsatisfying. The environments, however are incredibly made, and the bosses are unique and somewhat memorable. The world-building in general is creative and refreshing, but the combat and healing system falls short of the mark. Although this game is okay, it is not even close to being as good as Dark Souls or Dark Souls III. Other people may have their own opinions on this game, but I would say that if you are looking for the magic that made the other Souls games so beloved, you will not find it here, only a bittersweet taste of it, soiled by the poor design choices and unsatisfying combat. You will not feel accomplished after beating a boss, only relief that it's over."
"One of the BEST GAMES I EVER PLAYED. The toughest part of the game will the beginning and the ending of a game. Everything else, is beatable."
got meme'd on by a dude named John Dark Souls 3
"I cannot recommend this 20€ patch at the moment because the game goes 1 step forward, 1 step back. What i mean by this is that while the patch fixes some bugs and improves performance/gameplay in some aspects, it introduces new ones as well hell, it didn't even fix many known bugs from the original release. 

Some striking bugs: 

- Main menu running at double the normal speed, i've never seen the character blinking so fast in my life; 
- Music stopped working in loading character menu;
- Graphical issues (like missing textures, old textures and for some reason blue lights in certain spots) stayed the same;
- No anti-cheat whatsoever, this means cheaters will play as they please; 
- Multiplayer matches having allies and opponents teleporting everytime, there weren't enough ""nanis"" for the situation because it was happening all the time. This isn't exactly a bug but so much for ""dedicated servers"".

This might be the poorest ""remaster"" i've ever seen."
Tough but fair. There is allot of fun to be had if you can steel your resolve. Bringing friends along can make the game much more accessible to newcomers.
"I've played (but not completed) the first DS, but even with my very superficial understanding of that game, DS2 feels very different.  It actually feels ""easier"" to me: enemy attack patterns and movement are telegraphed clearer; area navigation makes more sense; recovering from death is faster and less jarring.  

Perhaps some would argue that this lowers the bar on the series, but I found the ""message"" of the DS series is more clearly demonstrated in DS2: dying is almost always your fault and greed (in both combat and exploration) is your biggest sin.  I feel that DS2 presents this theme more succinctly than DS1 and I prefer the former over the latter for this reason."

"Joguei todos os títulos posteriores da franquia, Dark Souls III foi terminado em uma primeira vez em meu Xbox, estava tão empolgado com jogo que não aproveitei nem um terço do que ele tinha a oferecer, agora vendo com mais calma, jogando devagarinho... Consigo ver a obra que este jogo é. Uma conclusão ótima para saga, um RPG único e acima de tudo, um jogo incrível. Praise the Sun!"
"Well, the game is in fact more linear than the previous entries to the series, and I personally really feel that, but the better boss quality and the fluidity, is just top notch. Great game."
"Beautiful game with great music that lets you invite a hoard of your friends, a hoard of invaders and get them to fight each other in hazardous environments. 9/11 will invite friends to praise the sun and die again.
P.S. Nameless king can put his swordspear so far up his arse.

"Brilliant!!, absolutely Brilliant

love me a good souls game 

time for NG+ baby"
"the game is good 
the port sucks monkeyballs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
A fun replayble game for new and old souls players fairly easy to pick up hard to master better with mates
i say naughty gamer words now
"Absolute masterpiece, I'm late to the game of course, and I'm stuck on I'd say what's probably supposed to be the 3rd boss in the game. But it's worth it. I wanted to get Elden Ring, but I'm deciding to at least play this some more before I buy another Souls like. :)

great i died so much such wow such amazing such deaths
Amazing gameplay and visuals. Challenging combat and posture/vitality system but very satisfying on soldier enemies when you get the hang of it. I haven't beaten it but it's an excellent game.
one of best games i have played. Hard but fun.
amazing game once you understand the combat mechanics. Highly recommend this
"surely one of the best games you will get to play, and try the cinders or convergence mod while you are at it. its worth it"
10/10 would betray the iron code again
Dark Souls 3.... it lives up to its name.
"Apesar de não ser tão bom qunato o primeiro, ainda garante horas de diversão.

Is not so good as the first one but still guarantees hours of fun."
"Don't let my low play-time fool you I've finished the game seven times on PS4 and I am still not tired of its bullshit. 

I am also still not good at the game. But wow I love it."
"This game was amazing. Elden Ring was my introduction to Souls-like games, and I liked that so much that I decided to come back and try Dark Souls. Despite being a much older game, it was still a great, polished game. The world design is iconic. The way it is so big but so beautifully compact and interconnected is a work of art. It starts off being so overwhelming, and then as you get familiar with the layout you can traverse the map so quickly. The exploration is extremely satisfying. The combat feels good. It was a bit tough going from the jumping of Elden Ring back to the more 2-dimensional combat, but it still feels good - challenging but fair.

Having only played through it once, build variety is hard to assess. I know that tanky melee builds work well, and that sorcery builds can be very strong as well. It doesn't seem like dexterity, status effects, archery, and some of those other builds are quite as viable as they are in elden ring, but maybe i just need to get more familiar with them.

One other down side is the inflexibility. There isn't any way to respec your character, so you're a bit locked in by your early game build choices. That's even true when you go into New Game +. It would be cool to be able to respec and play the game differently on subsequent plays without starting from scratch, but this is a minor complaint.

All told, this game is an iconic classic, and I would highly recommend to anyone. It's not as hard as people make it out to be. If you level up and use good weapons, you can get through much of the game without excessive or unreasonable challenge."
"Good game, a bit difficult tho."
"I died more than 2 times. But, really good game"
really good it is fun it is also good
"Even though Dark Souls Remastered is just a cash grab with a patch to the existing Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition, still this is goddamn Dark Souls  the combat the BOSSES are just phenomenal, One of the best games of all time."
"Best game I've ever played. The graphics are amazing and the cinematic cuts don't do it justice. The story is also very thought out. It's also the most difficult game I've ever played. All in all, I highly recommend this game."
"I don't know if anyone knows this in 2022, but Dark Souls is a good game."
"came for ornstein, left with dissapointment."
"1. Bloodborne
2. Dark Souls PTDE
3. Demon's Souls
4. Dark Souls 3
5. Elden Ring
6. Dark Souls 2 SotFS
7. Dark Souls 2
8. Dark Souls Remastered

"
"While, after nearly 200 hours between the first two Dark Souls titless with some change from just starting a file in SotFS, I still have some petty gripes over some tweaks that differentiate 2 for the original, this is by far and large one of the best games I've ever played. 

If you like challenging but fair difficulty, excellent high fantasy reminiscent of LoTR/D&D, an easy to learn but difficult to master mechanics, this series is for you. Scholar of the First Sin has gorgeous visuals that are an improvement over both Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, rearranged enemy and item placements that so far play much better for the length into the game I've gotten, and additional enemy and phantom placements over vanilla to up the challenge even more. Soundtrack is excellent as always.

I'd personally recommend Scholar of the First Sin edition to both vet Dark Souls players such as myself, and for those new to the series that only have the time and money for a single title to be in their library, this title should be the one. You can get an amazingly huge amount of game time from this one title from trying out different builds and playing in the PVP covenant arenas or being summoned into fightclubs.

One of the most solid $60 I've spent on a game."
"The most in-depth and effective gameplay mechanics I have ever seen, artfully crafted maps and foes coupled with a phenominal sense of adventure and discovery, make this one of the best games I have ever played.
The combat in this game feels raw and real and the experience will push you to your limits of resourcefullness, strategy and execution. The huge amount of control over your character makes the games challenge not only survivable but incredible fun. The sheer vastness of unique weapons all with varying move sets, speeds and styles alongside countless abilities, artifacts and armours allow the player to persue finely tailored builds and approaches to every uniqe encounter within the game.

The multiplayer element of this game blends extremly well with your gameplay. Exploring a vast unknown land where you feel the very map its-self is trying to off you creates an atmosphere of excellent tension where keeping your wits about you having a good plan are absolutely essential in your survival. The need for carefull gameplay to survive alongside other players invading your world as dark spirits naturally discourages lazy gameplay and always keeps you on your toes!

This is one of the few games I have ever actually enjoyed replaying and I would extremley recommend to thoses seeking a real challenge and a really well made game."
"If you want bragging rights, finish DSIII and then realize you now have to complete the rest of the trilogy because you are hooked."
gutter/black gulch is bad + early game is kinda meh since you have to farm for adp if you don't hate yourself but other than that this game is really good 10/10 would strength build again
I got gud. Truely a masterpiece.
"I think it's a real good game, it's also really well made, it has both, nice graphics and good game mechanics. Dark souls is also just as enjoyable both alone and with your friends."
"This game is masterpiece. Play the game watch a lore video after and your mind will be blown.

It has one the best indirect story telling I have ever seen"
"This is the DS for Chads. It's pretty damn fun once you get ~30 Adaptability. The bosses are extremely easy, but the areas are really hard sometimes. PVP is exceptionally fun, particularly for us parry-kings. If you want to 100% in 2023, good luck; Getting the bell covenant to rank 2 wasn't fun, but the Sun Bros rank 3 is so bad. Took 5hrs of efficient grinding(12+ kill per min of the enemy that drops item w/ max item discovery). Magic is really cool in DS2 and it makes me wonder how they messed it up so bad in other titles. Enjoy!"
"This game is amazing, just like all the other dark souls, well i didnt like dark souls 2 as much but i stil liked it and dark souls 1 hasnt aged all too well"
"Amazing

worst game in the series. still my favourite though. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
You're not a man until you play this game.
10/10 game if you like anal torture :)
"It's a great game full of secrets to uncover, mysteries to solve and endless frustration!"
"This is an amazing game. The gameplay and form of story telling is in your normal Soulsborne style, so take that as you may.    If you like the other games, this one is on par. The only problems I have with this game is a lot of  levels looks unfinished. There are plenty of flat and square rooms, which it pretty sad. Now there are amazing levels and set pieces but there are just as many that are meh. But at the end of the day, that's not a total deal breaker. The meat of the game is combat, and the combat is great. To say more would do an injustice to the game, it's best to just pick up this game and go."
Trash braindead game. Spam dodge with 0 downsides and you have to unless you want to use a shield. Only remotely hard thing in the game is the garbage camera and FOV. Levels are just a means to the boss instead of a mini-world you explore. Super ugly to look at.
"Beautiful game, amazing graphics. My advice to a new player is decide on whether you like it AFTER you beat Gundyr."
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
